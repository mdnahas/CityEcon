          <p class="bibitem-p" >I   skimmed   this   paper.   The   paper   compares   the   rent
          component of the CPI to two other rent indexes, Zillow&#8217;s ZORI
          and the Marginal Rent Index. The other indexes jumped up
          quickly and the CPI didn&#8217;t and that scared BLS.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The paper&#8217;s answer is that CPI measures the rent being
          paid now and the other indexes measure the rent on a newly
          signed contract. The contract, obviously, last 1 or 2 years so
          &#8220;the rent paid now&#8221; in the middle of the contract doesn&#8217;t
          match the rent on newly signed contracts. Thus, ZORI leads

          <p class="bibitem-p" >Estimated  the  value  of  land  under  American  cities  using
          68,756  land  transactions.  The  paper  gets  pretty  mathy  at
          points and I didn&#8217;t understand what they were doing. But,
          at  its  core,  it  is  a  hedonic  regression.  It  has  choices  that
          I  wouldn&#8217;t  make.  They  do  cross-validate  their  results.  I
          wish  they  reported  error  bounds  on  their  numbers  &#8212;  the
          price-per-acre in the center of the city is exponentially higher
          than average, so errors are magnified dramatically. They don&#8217;t
          look at the time series, to see if a change in any factor (like
          center-city prices) indicates a future change (like residential
          prices).
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Separated  samples  by  MSA,  or  primary  MSA.  Defined
          the &#8220;city center&#8221; to be City Hall or Mayor&#8217;s office. (That&#8217;s
          a   problem   in   NYC!   I  would   have   chosen   the   tallest
          building.)  Some  MSAs  have  multiple  city  centers  (like
          Minneapolis-St.Paul).  Land  is  associated  with  the  closest
          center. (That&#8217;s bad when a larger one dominates.) I don&#8217;t like
          that they don&#8217;t search for the center of the city and don&#8217;t try
          to discover more &#8220;centers&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   It  uses  hedonic  regression.  Log(land  price)  is  a  linear
          function  based  on  distance  from  the  city  center  and  other
          factors.  Distance  is  the  natural  log  of  1  +  the  Euclidean
          distance in miles. The distance constant varies by city. The
          intercept varies by city and year. The linear function is also
          adjusted for lot size and proposed used, which can vary by
          time. Figure 1 shows a plot from Houston and the linear model
          seems like a good fit. When they allow multiple powers of their
          distance function in the linear regression, there is a higher
          peak downtown and a flattening of the rest of the graph.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They  have  little  data  and  do  some  math  to  create  an
          average city of a given area. I&#8217;m not sure how this works. They
          do a similar thing with changes over time.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   To estimate the value of the whole city, they use their
          function to predict the price at the centroid of each census
          tract. Then they sum all the tracts in the city.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They find that larger cities have a higher intercept (central
          land  value).  Larger  cities  have  a  steeper  slope.  There  is
          much variation here, but the trend is for large cities to have
                                                                          

                                                                          
          downtown values that are 7 times those 10 miles away. For
          smaller cities, the value is 1, meaning no change in land value
          from downtown to 10 miles away. The average land value for
          cities is pretty flat.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   As  for  intended  use,  &#8220;Retail,  apartment,  mixed  use,
          and medical proposed uses have substantially higher values,
          while commercial, industrial, and multifamily uses have lower
          values.&#8221;  I&#8217;m  not  sure  how  &#8220;multifamily&#8221;  is  different  from
          &#8220;apartment&#8221;. It doesn&#8217;t list single-family, but the appendix
          says it is near zero.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The highest central land values are NY, Chicago, D.C., San
          Francisco, and Los Angeles-Long Beach. The steepest price
          slope goes to Chicago and then Washington D.C.. The flattest
          expensive cities are San Jose and Orange County, CA. The
          higher average land values tend to be on the coast. (Why?)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Total land value is NYC at <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>2.5T, LA at <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>2.3T, then SF,
          D.C., and Chicago. They account for 48% of all urban land
          value. The total value for the USA in 2010 was <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>19.1T. An
          alternate way of measuring, &#8220;Flow of Funds&#8221;, put it at <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>6.2T.
          It only measures private land and covers the whole country;
          this paper&#8217;s method covers all of cities, including roads, parks,
          etc..
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Over time, the land value drops 40% after the Financial
          Crisis. The Case-Shiller index drops 19%. Their values don&#8217;t
          line up with the stock market&#8217;s movements at the time.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >I  have  read  half  of  this  book.  It  was  recommended  for
          a  reading  group.  This  is  a  great  book.  It  is  well  written
          and  it  is  hard  to  summarize,  given  how  much  information
          is  in  it.  Not  just  on  &#8220;exactions&#8221;  but  on  every  aspect  of
                                                                          

                                                                          
          housing and land development. The book&#8217;s central topic is
          &#8220;exactions&#8221;.  Exactions  are  charges  or  costly  requirements
          for building/property when connecting to city infrastructure,
          in  order  to  pay  for  the  infrastructure.  This  may  be  a
          charge  for  roads,  water,  or  sewage.  There  are  borderline
          may-be-exactions such as &#8220;inclusive zoning&#8221;, which requires
          builders of apartments include some low-rent apartments.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The way cities pay for local infrastructure, like roads and
          sewage, has changed over time. Initially, developers just built
          houses and let the city put in after the homes were built. But
          developers didn&#8217;t take the cost of infrastructure into account
          and either, it was costly to cities or it didn&#8217;t get built.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Cities  then  mandated  infrastructure  as  part  of  new
          developments. But that was expensive.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Then, came special assessment bonds. These bonds paid
          for the infrastructure, paid for by a property tax (or lien?) on
          the homes there. But, during an economic downtown, bonds
          defaulted  and  there  were  &#8220;widespread  foreclosures  against
          individual homeowners&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   It sounds like after that period, infrastructure was paid
          by property tax. But that is often not enough to pay for our
          expensive infrastructure. Especially after anti-tax &#8220;revolts&#8221;,
          like  Prop  13  in  California.  Cities  started  charging  fees  or
          requiring  land/buildings  when  new  houses  are  connected
          to  the  infrastructure.  Cities  have  expanded  these  include
          &#8220;social regulation&#8221;, such as including low-cost housing. But,
          in  Berkeley,  there  are  charges  for  child  care,  public  art,
          local hiring, etc.. These non-monetary exactions are hard for
          economists to measure. (NOTE: Exactions have a long history;
          exaction of land for roads has existed since early American
          cities.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  book  goes  into  the  political  structure  of  cities.
          Often there is a &#8220;progrowth coalition&#8221; made of: landowners,
          developers,  construction  companies,  law  firms,  real  estate
          brokerages,  other  businesses,  and  organized  labor.  The
          businesses expect more customers and more profits. Organized
          labor expects more jobs.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   In the 1970s, there started to be anti-growth coalitions.
                                                                          

                                                                          
          These were made of neighborhood associations, environmental
          groups, and anti-tax groups. Good government groups, like
          the League of Women Voters, have fought for transparency
          and community input, which have been used by anti-growth
          coalitions.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The authors comment that developers are actually very
          weak in city politics. They want permits and zoning changes
          and, therefore, cower to local politicians. They may organize
          at the state level.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Often, exactions are good city politics. They are charged
          only  to  new  comers.  The  authors  mention  that  state
          governments care about new comers and see their role as local
          oversight.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Cities will example how much a developer can afford. This
          sounds like extortion to me. Some cities limit growth and start
          a bidding war of &#8220;voluntary&#8221; exactions from developers.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The book talks about the legality of exactions. Exactions
          are part of land use regulations, and regulatory authority is
          limited. Land use regulations fall under &#8220;the police power&#8221;,
          which  allows  states  to  regulate  for  public  health,  safety,
          and welfare. This means exactions are fees, which can only
          pay for the cost of the service. (They are not taxes, which
          can pay for anything.) Therefore, cities have built complex
          &#8220;linkages&#8221; where new business buildings pay for many things,
          including the low-cost housing their employees will require.
          (In Massachusetts, the state government made exactions into
          taxes, to avoid a legal challenge.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   State  courts  have  ruled  that  subdivision  of  land  is  a
          privilege, not a right, so conditions can be required for it.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Developers encouraged court rulings to be put into state
          laws. This got rid of uncertainty. And, developers hoped that
          cities wouldn&#8217;t ask for more.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   While early city laws set out the rules for building, the
          decisions  have  become  more  and  more  at  the  discretion
          of  the  city  government.  Courts  accept  this.(Even  though
          we  no  longer  have  the  rule  of  law!)  Developers,  in  strong
          markets, are induced give &#8220;voluntary&#8221; exactions at multiple
          points  in  the  approval  process.  Justice  Scalia  pointed  out
                                                                          

                                                                          
          in  Nollan  that  local  governments  could  tighten  regulations
          just to improve their negotiating position. Officially, &#8220;selling&#8221;
          permission is illegal, but many politicians think it is okay to
          squeeze developers for their constituents. Despite this power,
          corruption scandals have been rare.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Developers can always walk away. They can also appeal to
          the state government. And they can negotiate. Against smaller
          and medium-sized cities, the authors think that developers are
          often the better negotiators. Aurora, Colorado is an example
          of a harsh negotiating city. It has water rights in an arid region.
          The city uses special assessment districts to collect taxes for
          each annexation.

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This is an innovative paper that showed a lot of statistics on
          cities follow a power-law distribution of the city&#8217;s population.
          An important statistic is GDP and, because the coefficient
          is greater than 1, it means that GDP grows super-linearly
          with the size of the city. Or, equivalently, that GDP-per-capita
          grows with the size of a city. But many other statistics follow
          the same pattern: new patents, R&amp;D spending, bank deposits,
          crime,  walking  speed,  gas  stations,  road  surface,  etc..  The
          coefficients are different for different statistics. For roads and
          gas stations, the coefficient is below 1, so the larger the city
          is, the fewer gas-stations-per-capita.
                                                                          

                                                                          
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The authors go further and set up an differential equation
          for city growth based on a power law distribution. I don&#8217;t like
          this extrapolation. It leads to infinite growth in a finite amount
          of time. The authors get around this by saying that innovation
          must happen which reset the equation to initial conditions. I
          don&#8217;t like that fix. It would be easier to add additional terms
          to the differential equation. E.g., crime or disease grows with
          a different coefficient, restricting city size.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   It&#8217;s  an  interesting  paper.  The  collection  of  different

          stretches it out to 220 pages. The core idea is that suburbs are
          expensive. There is a high cost for the infrastructure to attach
          a suburban house to the road network, water network, sewage
          network, etc.. This is because suburban houses are far apart.
          Cities often don&#8217;t notice that those high costs often exceed the
          property tax that is collected from the house. Thus, suburbs
          hurt city&#8217;s finances. The same applies to &#8220;big box&#8221; stores on
          the edge of a city.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   It would have loved if this book had a good &#8220;aha&#8221; story,
          elaborated on the core idea, provided examples, and discussed
          solutions. But that&#8217;s not what this book does. It talks about
          &#8220;complicated systems&#8221; vs. &#8220;complex systems&#8221;. It messes up
          finances. (The author doesn&#8217;t count suburban infrastructure
          as &#8220;assets&#8221;, but calls them &#8220;liabilities&#8221;. What he should call
          them is &#8220;non-performing assets&#8221;. ) He talks about pre-building
          infrastructure vs. waiting for demand. He talks about &#8220;infinite
          baseball games&#8221; in one of the worst metaphors I&#8217;ve seen. He
          gives bad investment advice. And more. This book is a mess.
          The author is a professional engineer and doesn&#8217;t include a
          detailed example with numbers. WTF?!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  author  does  explain  that  the  state  and  federal
          government  helped  cause  the  problem.  By  subsidizing  new
          infrastructure,  especially  road  construction,  its  costs  do
          not  show  up  in  the  city&#8217;s  budget.  In  fact,  building  more
          infrastructure  can  help  solve  temporary  budget  problems!
          Only when growth has stopped and that infrastructure needs
          to be replaced do cities see the financial mess they are in.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Because this book is disorganized, it doesn&#8217;t say clearly
          how to measure the problem and how to fix it. I believe the
          best way to measure the problem is to assign infrastructure
          costs  to  each  address  and  then  compare  that  against  the
          taxes paid. The solution, which the author stuck in corner, is
          for cities to prioritize the &#8220;profitable&#8221; parts of town, where
          revenues exceed costs. If there&#8217;s a surplus, the city should try
          to preserve the parts that don&#8217;t lose the city too much money.
          To avoid bankruptcy, cities will need to abandon the least
          profit parts of town. And those least profitable ones are the
                                                                          

                                                                          
          fringe of suburbs and big box stores.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I do not recommend this book. Its idea is very important.
          You should know the idea. But I think this summary explains
          the idea clearly and you will not gain any more insight about
          the idea by reading the 220 page book.</p></div>

          don&#8217;t like that it is on a county basis &#8212; that&#8217;s such a large
                                                                          

                                                                          
          scale that it is surprising to see any effect. My data on land
          prices in Austin shows that prices change dramatically in a
          few blocks; Travis County is many many block-widths across.
          If density increases exponentially as we get to the center of
          Austin, the average density of Travis County doesn&#8217;t measure
          that peak. What I&#8217;m saying is that we need good find-detail
          data for measuring cities.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >The authors felt that the press, public, and even policy makers
          had  a  mistaken  view  of  the  causes  of  homelessness.  They
          wanted to present simple plots of data showing that many
          commonly discussed &#8220;causes&#8221; are not the cause. And that the
          price of housing was.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Page 13 and 14 have a great metaphor: musical chairs. A
          person with a cast doesn&#8217;t get a seat, but it isn&#8217;t because he
          cannot get to a chair. It is because there is 1 fewer chairs
          than people. Such is homelessness &#8212; we see a lot of individual
          factors (mental health, addiction, race, etc.) that affect who
          doesn&#8217;t gets a home, but we need to look at citywide factors
          that cause a home shortage.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  data  is  strange.  They  want  to  use  the  35  largest
          cities  by  metro  area.  (Why  35??)  They  drop  6  because
          HUD&#8217;s Continuity of Care (CoC) region covers &#8220;too large a
          geographic area&#8221;. The dropped cities are Houston, Riverside
          (CA), Denver, Orlando, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City (MO).
          The rest are split into two groups, where the CoC matches the
          city (20 of them) or the county (10 of them). Chicago appears
          in both groups. They cover years 2007 to 2019, but admit that
          the PIT Count (their measure of homelessness) is iffy in some
          cities and especially in the early few years.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Over time, homelessness has dropped on average. But the
                                                                          

                                                                          
          variance has increased.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They talk about the PIT Count (&#8221;homeless census&#8221;). Most
          homelessness is temporary, but some is long-term. Because the
          PIT Count is a single day, it emphasizes the long-term. If it
          was people over the year, the temporary ones would show up
          more.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Homeless   are   more   likely   to   be:   male,   unmarried,
          low-income,  old,  non-white,  and  queer.  They  are  socially
          isolated:  fewer  family  ties  and  far  from  family.  They  are
          more likely to be depressed, mentally ill, abused drugs, abuse
          alcohol,  have  a  conviction  and  been  incarcerated.  70%  are
          individuals,  usually  male.  30%  are  families,  which  tend  to
          undergo temporary homelessness.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Cost per homeless is <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>30,000 to <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>100,000 for government
          services.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The book has good data on poverty, which is negatively
          correlated  with  homelessness.  Unemployment  is  negatively
          correlated with homelessness. It is odd that they plot data
          points  for  every  year  and  don&#8217;t  estimate  fixed-effects  for
          cities. (E.g., does an increase in poverty cause an increase in
          homelessness?)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Mental   illness   and   drug   use   are   measured   on   a
          statewide-basis. That seems to large a scale.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Race  is  negatively  correlated  with  homelessness.  Black
          people are more likely to be homeless, but cities with more
          Black residents have a lower rate of homelessness!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Temperature  is  handled  badly.  They  use  the  average
          temperature for the month of January ... even though the
          PIT Count was on a specific day? The county data shows no
          correlation of warmer winters with homelessness, but the city
          data does. They fight that result by combining the data using
          &#8220;indexed homelessness&#8221; (described on pages 20 to 22) which is,
          let&#8217;s say, not a well-known technique. The anecdotal evidence
          &#8212; that cold NYC has more homeless than warm southern
          cities &#8212; is much stronger than their data.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They   admit   that   temperature   is   correlated   with
          unsheltered homeless. They explain that this may be because
          cold cities spend more on shelter than warmer cities, which
                                                                          

                                                                          
          may spend on outdoor services.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Generous  social  services  is  also  done  differently.  It
          measures  the  state&#8217;s  maximum  TANF  (&#8221;Welfare&#8221;)  benefit
          against  family  homelessness  rate.  It  uses  families,  because
          individuals rarely qualify for TANF. This does not seem like
          a good measure.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The   show   that   low-income   migration   is   negatively
          correlated with homelessness. They try to say this shows the
          cities with high homelessness are not &#8220;welfare magnets&#8221;. To
          me, that data means other things.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They  handle  political  party  anecdotally,  citing  that
          Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland are highly Democratic cities
          with  low  homelessness.  The  authors  inveigh  against  harsh
          police treatment of the homeless and say there is no evidence
          that it does more than hide the problem.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They do a strange interlude to look at cost-burden-ness as
          a cause of homelessness. They find when the median person
          spend more on housing, homelessness goes down in cities. But
          not in counties. And the result doesn&#8217;t hold when looking at
          the &#8220;first-quartile housing cost burden&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   What should be the finale is the comparison of median
          rent, vacancy, first-quartile rent, and &#8220;first-quartile vacancy&#8221;
          (vacancy in lowest 1/4 rent apartments). Rent and vacancy
          are inversely correlated and both predict homelessness. The
          strongest is median rent which has an R-squared of 55% for
          cities and first-quartile rent which has an R-squared of 28%
          for counties. (For vacancy, they regress against log(vacancy),
          which is a strange choice since both homeless rate and vacancy
          are on a scale of 0 to 100%. They don&#8217;t apply log to rent, where
          it would be more natural. And they don&#8217;t do log(vacancy)
          when showing it correlates with rent. These are inconsistent
          strange choices.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Page 134 says that they did a full model with fixed-city
          effects ... but don&#8217;t show its results. Not even in an appendix.
          WTF.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The rest of the book doesn&#8217;t follow their thesis. They see if
          growth is correlated with homelessness and find it isn&#8217;t. They
          mention a study shows that inequality is causal ... but say it
                                                                          

                                                                          
          isn&#8217;t in their data (without any plots).
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They  eventually  say  that  economics  believe  supply  is
          limited  by  geography  (oceans,  mountains,  etc.)  and  by
          regulation. They then group cities by elasticity (a measure
          of supply limitations) and growth. (So, now, they&#8217;re saying
          growth <span 
class="cmti-12">does </span>matter.) And the worst cities have high growth
          and low elasticity. I expected the book to end here saying &#8220;we
          need to fix the regulation in high-growth cities&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   But,  no.  We  get  38  pages  of  their  vague  plan  to  fix
          homelessness. After a data-driven book focused on proving one
          point, it is huge jumble of opinion at the finish. They dismiss
          filtering without a citation on page 134. They put together a
          mushy argument against markets on pages 171 to 173. They
          say private markets won&#8217;t create houses for people with no
          income, but ignore the idea of giving money to those people.
          After citing economists earlier, they say &#8220;housing must be
          de-commodified&#8221;. They mention that building houses has not
          come down in price like building iPhones, but don&#8217;t mention
          that most cities ban manufactured homes on most land. It
          goes on: public perception, funding, and more. Way too much
          for a single chapter.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  book&#8217;s  data  is  passable  &#8212;  it  is  clear  enough  to
          make most of their thesis&#8217;s points &#8212; but I think it needs a
          much stronger analysis in an appendix. The book never really
          addressed how to handle correlations in data samples from
          the same city in different years. The writing began well but it
          totally flubbed the landing. The last chapter should have been
          cut and become the basis for the author&#8217;s next book. But it did
          well enough to make its point and that&#8217;s an accomplishment.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This paper tries to compute a land price for a large portion
          of  America&#8217;s  cities.  It  uses  property  appraisals,  probably
          for  mortgage  applications,  from  the  GSEs  (Government
          Sponsored Enterprises, like Ginnie Mae). It puts those into a
          model to find land prices. It interpolates those land prices to
          all land using an averaging technique called &#8220;kriging&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The model is pretty simple. It says that, for land plus a
          structure, the value of the structure decreases over time. The
          results of the model are two. For recently build houses, the
          land is probably valued at the price of the whole property
          minus the replacement construction cost for the building. For
          very  old  houses,  the  property  is  almost  all  land-value  and
          not  building-value.  I  don&#8217;t  like  this  model  &#8212;  there  is  an
          option-value not accounted for: to tear down a building and
          rebuild whatever is most valuable then.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They limit their data to homes where the &#8220;effective age&#8221;
          is less than 15 years old. I guess these are well-maintained
          buildings. They drop appraisals that they think are generated
          from tax appraisals (which they don&#8217;t trust). They only allow
          reconstruction costs from a handful of well-known sources.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They adjust for the size of the lot, etc..
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Given those land prices, they interpolate the data to all
          lots using kriging. That&#8217;s an average of nearby known data
          points, weighted by distance. They used the 20 closest points.
          It looks like weights were determined for the closest 6.9 miles
          in 15 bins. Its a good technique, but it does use averaging, so
          it doesn&#8217;t follow trends to predict peaks or cusps.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They generate prices for 960 counties, 7,742 ZIP codes,
          and 10,515 Census tracts.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They show prices as a distance from the CBD for various
          city  sizes.  They  go  down  almost  exponentially,  as  you  get
          farther from the CBD. Larger cities are more expensive than
          smaller ones. Cities with more regulations have higher prices.
          Cities with more natural barriers have higher prices.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   In larger cities, the land makes up more of a share of the
          property price. It is 40 to 45% downtown in cities with over 2
          million housing units.
                                                                          

                                                                          
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Figure 6(a) shows how counties with more expensive land
          have  more  square-footage  of  structures.  But  the  slope  is
          smaller and the variance much higher than I expected. Figure
          6(b)  shows  that  expensive  land  is  usually  associated  with
          smaller  lot  sizes.  That  has  a  high  variance  too.  Perhaps
          counties are too large and that&#8217;s causing the high variances?
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Figure 6(c) compares county land prices for housing and
          for agriculture. The authors say it &#8220;shows a strong positive
          relationship&#8221;, but the scatter-plot looks odd. And the scales
          are off completely. The median agriculture price for a county
          is <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>3,000 per acre, while the median single-family land price
          is around <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>100,000 per acre! I don&#8217;t get it.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Figure 9(a) is interesting. It breaks the counties into bins
          by the number of single-family units. The counties with the
          most houses saw the largest price increases from 2012-2019.
          Also the most increase in land value &#8212; especially in the top
          bin. That was enough to drag the national average to a 7%
          annual increase, even though smaller counties averaged a 2 or
          3% increase.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I think this is a good paper, but it&#8217;s mostly because I
          see it as an engineering project. The model and some choices
          aren&#8217;t ideal, but they got something that works for the whole
          country. I&#8217;m interested to download the data and take a look
          at it.</p></div>

          The show that cities with more commuters have more traffic

          then they look at individual cities and its different!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Some  cities  follow  a  power  law,  but  with  a  different
          exponent. Other cities&#8217; plots of population vs. delay have two
          regimes: a power law where delay rose quickly until a certain
                                                                          

                                                                          
          amount and, then, a flatter portion following another power
          law. The authors believe a capacity or behavioral limit was
          hit. E.g., in Birmingham, the distance driven per driver was
          increasing until 1998, at which it started to decrease and the
          delay-per-driver flattened.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The delay is on a log scale, so fast growing cities really
          hit a wall in congestion. So, Cincinnati started on the steep
          portion of the plot with 10 hours of delay per year. A decade
          later, it hit 25 or 30 hours of delay per year and then started
          to flat-line. Three decades later, the delay was still under 40
          hours per year.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I&#8217;m fascinated by the paper&#8217;s Figure 2. It shows that the
          power-law coefficient for all cities dropped from 1980 to 2007,
          and then flattened. So, delay was much worse in large cities in
          1980, but the difference between large and small cities got less
          over time. Figure 3 makes me believe that this is because delay
          got worse in smaller cities, not better in large ones. Maybe
          it is because more small cities grew into larger cities and hit
          their capacity limits?

          <p class="bibitem-p" >An impressive paper. This paper tries to determine if building
          roads or widening lanes is better for a city. The title comes
          from a quote from Downs 1962, that the &#8220;fundamental law
          of  highway  congestion&#8221;  is  that,  if  you  widen  a  congested
          highway, the traffic will increase until the congestion is just as
          bad as before construction. The authors say that they verify
          the  statement:  &#8220;increased  provision  of  interstate  highways
          and  major  urban  roads  is  unlikely  to  relieve  congestion  of
                                                                          

                                                                          
          these roads&#8221;. They also find &#8220;no evidence that the provision
          of  public  transportation  affects&#8221;  vehicle-kilometers-traveled
          (VKT).
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They measure how VKT changes as more lane-kilometers
          of road are added to a city.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They study 228 MSA (metro areas of cities), in 1983, 1993,
          and 2003. Roads have 6 different classifications. They ignore
          local roads. They study interstate highways separately. The
          4 other classes of non-local roads get grouped into &#8220;major
          urban roads&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t find a description of &#8220;local roads&#8221; or
          how much of a city that makes up. (Are Manhattan&#8217;s streets
          &#8220;local roads&#8221;?) For interstates, they separate them into the
          &#8220;urban&#8221; and &#8220;non-urban&#8221; parts, but I don&#8217;t have a sense of
          how that division was made.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Under  plain  OLS,  for  interstates  in  urban  areas,  the
          coefficient of between <span

class="cmmi-12">ln</span>(<span 
class="cmmi-12">V KT</span>) is very close to
          1. R-squares are .95 to .96, too. The coefficients for &#8220;major
          urban roads&#8221; is .70 to .88. For non-urban interstates, they&#8217;re
          from 0.82 to 0.84.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The coefficients for <span

class="cmmi-12">population</span>) is &#8220;much less than 1 in
          all specification&#8221; ... but seems to be 1.01 in Table 3, regression
          #3. All others are in the range .5 to .3, which says population
          doesn&#8217;t affect driving as much as building roads.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They realize that congested cities are more likely to get
          roads  added  to  them,  so  they  use  instrumental  variables
          to  separate  that  causality.  But  they  only  do  this  for
          all  interstates.  Not  &#8220;major  urban  roads&#8221;  and  they  don&#8217;t
          break interstates into &#8220;urban&#8221; and &#8220;non-urban&#8221; parts. The
          instruments are old maps of the railroads, explorations, and
          the plans for the interstates in 1947.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   For the IV regressions, they get coefficients around 1. They
          say their preferred estimate is panel A, column 3, which has
          a value of 1.03.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They do another IV regression, but for how much buses
          (not trains) contribute to reducing VKT. Their instruments
          are the highway plan, railroad plan, and the 1972 election.
          They  use  an  &#8220;ILML  regression&#8221;  rather  than  2SLS  &#8220;since
          our  set  of  instruments  is  sometimes  marginal  weak&#8221;.  The
                                                                          

                                                                          
          coefficient for buses is close to zero and, in some regressions,
          statistically indistinguishable from zero.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They  do  a  regression  that  tries  to  show  that  there&#8217;s  a
          &#8220;natural level of traffic&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t understand what they did
          here. They got negative coefficients and claimed there was
          mean reversion.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They  try  do  determine  where  the  additional  interstate
          VKT are coming from. They look at commercial trucking,
          residents, population growth, and diversion from one set of
          roads  to  another.  They  find  commercial  trucking  increases
          with interstate lane-km. As does residential driving, a little.
          Population too. But more interstate lane-km doesn&#8217;t divert
          very much from other roads.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   For a traffic increase, they conclude: trucking accounts for
          19 to 29%, population increase for 5 to 21%, residential driving
          for 9 to 39%, and diversion from other roads 0 to 10%. The
          true values would have to be at the upper end of those ranges
          to account for all the traffic.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The authors mention congestion, but the paper doesn&#8217;t
          actually mention delay. They show coefficients around 1 for
          urban interstates in almost every test. Still, it seems those
          highways carry more cars if population increases. Maybe not
          at rush-hour? I would have liked to see the breakdown by
          &#8220;roads that have stoplights&#8221; and &#8220;roads that do not&#8221;. As for
          the expanded capacity, it is used by more by local residents
          and diverts capacity (thru-truckers and migrants) from other
          cities.  So  it  is  productively  being  used,  not  just  causing
          needless delays.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Maybe  we  need  to  expand  interstates  even  more?  I&#8217;d
          definitely prefer congestion pricing, though.</p></div>

          massaging it until I got its arguments.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   This  blog  post&#8217;s  big  point  is  that  we&#8217;ve  split  the
          housing  market  in  two:  one  for  landlords  and  another
          for  owner-occupied  housing.  The  owner-occupiers  get  tax
          benefits,  mortgage  deduction  benefits,  etc.  and  pay  less
          per-year for their house. That&#8217;s an economic rent. To exclude
          people  from  gaining  it,  there&#8217;s  a  bidding  contest  and  the
          creditworthy and wealthy win it.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  author  packed  a  lot  of  other  points  into  the  blog
          post. One is that a property is a risky asset. In a well-run
          market, that risk should be diversified by combining it with
          other risky assets. Under Market Portfolio Theory, only the
          (entire)  market  risk  has  a  risk-adjusted  excess  profit.  But
          we&#8217;ve structured the housing market so that houses are not
          diversified. Thus, homeownership comes with a risk premium.
          This adds to the benefits of homeownership. (If you&#8217;re wealthy
          enough to survive the risk!)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Politicians say they want everyone to be middle class and
          owning a home is part of that. But benefits of owning a home
          come from the economic rents, so they cannot be available to
          everyone.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author says that the economic rents are reserved for
          the creditworthy. In the lead up to the Financial Crisis, credit
                                                                          

                                                                          
          was extended to a lot more people. This expanded the number
          of owner-occupiers bidding on houses and prices rose. When
          credit was withdrawn, it was left to landlords to bid on houses.
          Given their higher per-year costs, they couldn&#8217;t bid as high for
          the houses. Thus, the crash. (This paragraph has been what
          I believe the author meant; it wasn&#8217;t perfectly clear.)

          <p class="bibitem-p" >The paper claims that zoning took off in the 1910&#8217;s because
          of  large  gas-powered  vehicles.  The  bus  and  truck  allowed
          apartments and industry to operate on land in the suburbs.

          would merge with the larger, to get its services as business
          developed. But, with the new legal power, smaller cities could

          uses of land should be regarded as less important. Apartment
          dwellers are as much citizens as home dwellers; owning has
          long commanded no special municipal privilege.&#8221; (pg. 17)

          un-diversifiable asset and form political entities to protect its
          value.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author says that people only started to notice zoning&#8217;s
          affect on housing prices around 1970. He&#8217;s not sure why it
          showed up then. One theory is that &#8220;industrial parks&#8221; showed
          up and suburbs got some jobs. This drew poor and Blacks
          (freed by civil rights lawsuits) to move nearby. Suburbs forced
          high land prices to keep them out. The author believes that
          exclusion is far more income-based than racial.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   To validate the new exclusion, suburbs used environmental
          and &#8220;growth management&#8221; language. The rules advocated for
          larger lots and open space zoning. (Open space zoning used
          large lots and banned development in large areas under the
          term &#8220;conservation&#8221;.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Also in the 1970s era, Regional government entities were
          set up. This was called &#8220;The Quiet Revolution&#8221; by Bosselman
          and Callies (1971). The regional entities used &#8220;double veto&#8221;:
          things could be vetoed at either the local or regional level.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   As for solutions, the author suggests taxing the imputed
          rent  of  owner-occupied  houses.  This  would  lower  home
          ownership.   Switzerland   does   this   and   has   30%   home
          ownership. He admits that this is an &#8220;unlikely policy&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The other solution is home equity insurance. The author
          cites many sources for a few programs on page 30. He wants
          to  insure  the  price  of  a  <span 
class="cmti-12">neighborhood</span>,  not  the  whole  city.
          He realizes there is moral hazard. And it would be hard to
          calculate. And hard to get off the ground.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   My   opinion   is   that   the   author   does   a   great   job
          of  demonstrating  that  the  invention  of  buses  and  truck
          contributed, and may have been the primary cause, of zoning
          being adopted nation-wide. It seems like that zoning was to
          preserve home values. But it changed later, as a means to fight
                                                                          

                                                                          
          growth. I don&#8217;t think the author finds the meat there. I don&#8217;t
          think taxing the imputed rent is politically viable, at any level
          of government. I like the idea of insuring home values, but
          insurance is a one-sided option with a lot of down-side for
          the seller. I don&#8217;t think you could find investors with enough
          capital to insure every house in America&#8217;s cities.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This paper explores the motivations of NIMBY&#8217;s, who oppose
          new construction in their neighborhood. He says, &#8220;It&#8217;s the
          variance, dummy!&#8221;. Homeowners have sunk all their money
          into  a  single  risky  asset  and  they  fear  its  crash.  When
          evaluating any change to a neighborhood, they look at the
          potential downside.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He points out that you rarely find NIMBYs among either
          apartment owners or apartment dwellers. Occasionally, you
          find business owners, but they are usually trying to prevent
          competition.  He  believe  apartment  owners  face  the  same
          effects as homeowners, but are more diversified.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He says that new homeowners are just as NIMBY as old
          ones.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He  says  homeowners  are  astute  judges  of  their  house&#8217;s
          value.  Prices  include  costs  such  as  property  taxes,  health
          hazards,  congestion,  school  quality,  crime  rates,  and  air
          pollution. They also price-in events in the future, like potential
          industrial construction nearby.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He discusses house-price insurance, but says it is hard to
          write the contract that a homeowner wants and an insurer will
          accept. It is hard to price the effects on a particular house or
          neighborhood. If a homeowner signs, they might not maintain
          the house, in order to get a larger payout. Also, there is a risk
                                                                          

                                                                          
          of an insurer going bankrupt, since the one-sided risk is so
          large.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He mentions that house-price insurance is not a panacea.
          If homeowners are insured against losses, they don&#8217;t do what&#8217;s
          best for the neighborhood! We need <span 
class="cmti-12">some </span>NIMBYism. So, he
          doesn&#8217;t advocate becoming a renter-majority society.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He  says,  &#8220;it  is  worth  wrestling  with  the  problems  of
          homeowner insurance contracts as a solution to the NIMBY
          problem&#8221;. He says other solutions are possible. One is Caplin
          et al. 1991, where homeowners enter partnerships. Another
          is Case-Shiller home-value insurance using a city-wide index.
          Any  diversification  helps.  &#8220;It  may  be  that  the  NIMBY
          problem will fade as a result of more efficient financial markets
          rather than political reforms.&#8221;.</p></div>

          divided by the median rent for a unit of that size. The &#8220;excess
          size cost&#8221; is the median rent for a unit of the size divided by

          baseline&#8221; is the median rent of households of that size divided
          by the median income of households of that size. And, lastly,
          the &#8220;income gap&#8221; is the median income of households of that

          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Multiplying those 4 factors together gives you the rent

          households where the rent burden is greater than 30% and
          where it is less than and compares the values of the factors.

          groups. The biggest difference is in the &#8220;income gap&#8221;. The

          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He does a more localized breakdown for New England. In
          Southwest Connecticut and Massachusetts Bay, the &#8220;rent gap&#8221;
          has a larger effect there, almost equal to the &#8220;income gap&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   A  very  good  paper.  My  hypothesis  is  that  families  at
          all  income  levels  spend  about  57%  of  their  consumption
          on housing and transportation. Thus, a higher rent burden
          is where transportation is cheap. That is, public transit is
          common. That the &#8220;rent gap&#8221; is largest in the densest parts
          of the state, seems to support that idea.</p></div>

          from them has their own names: wages, interest, and rent. A
          lot of income goes to renting land, because of monopoly and

          harm the economy because less labor is done and less capital

          <p class="bibitem-p" >A very readable book that argues that zoning is unnecessary.
          It describes what zoning does (restricts use, restricts size) and
          what it does not do (mandate construction, protect health and
          safety, protect the environment, plan for the future). Zoning
          doesn&#8217;t even &#8220;solve&#8221; the problem of externalities like noise,
          smell, shade, etc..
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   In NYC, zoning was instituted to restrict building size. The
          Equitable Building was so large that the price of office space
          plummeted.  Zoning  limited  building  volume  so  that  didn&#8217;t
          happen again.
                                                                          

                                                                          
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Berkeley  implemented  an  early  zoning  plan  for  other
          reasons.   &#8220;Residential   areas&#8221;   kept   apartments   of   poor
          (including  &#8220;negroes  and  Orientals&#8221;)  out  of  the  suburbs.
          Banning businesses kept Chinese-laundry (and the Chinese)
          out of the suburbs. Berkeley&#8217;s zoning was non-hierarchical &#8212;
          it kept residential out of industrial areas. This was used by
          business interests to force housing out of downtown areas and
          attract more businesses (with jobs and tax revenue).
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Zoning drives up prices. Single-room occupancies (SROs)
          are banned. Parking required. Heights limited. Empty land
          mandated. The approval process delays housing. Etc. It makes
          cities worse and America poorer.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Zoning was enabled by and enabled segregation. By race
          and class.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Fixing  the  problems  requires  loosening  zoning,  but  the
          author  considers  abolishing  it  all  together.  Zoning  doesn&#8217;t
          accomplish its goals. It doesn&#8217;t address most externalities and,
          those it does, it does roughly. It isn&#8217;t the best mechanism for
          planning growth.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Houston is the example of a city without zoning. Most
          of  its  residents&#8217;  desire  for  zoning  is  fulfilled  by  deed
          restrictions, which are enforced by the city government. Some
          of  zoning&#8217;s  aspects  show  up  elsewhere  (don&#8217;t  build  in  a
          floodplain, optional parking minimums, some business banned
          everywhere in the city). Houston is still segregated by use,
          but that is driven by the market. I wish the author had gone
          into  more  detail  on  this  important  aspect  of  the  solution:
          &#8220;As  Siegan  observes,  it&#8217;s  not  uncommon  for  homeowners&#8217;
          associations to simply pay off owners of abutting properties
          to  avoid  more  offensive  uses,  such  as  gas  stations  or  car
          dealerships&#8221;. (Page 155)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author says that if zoning is abolished, planning needs
          to change. Laws need to focus on externalities directly, like
          noise and smell. Planner&#8217;s duties can be replaced by mediators.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  author  says  that  planning  needs  to  fight  the
          segregation that it helped create. Not just remove zoning, but
          use the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and
          Section 8 vouchers to put poorer families in high-opportunity
                                                                          

                                                                          
          areas.  The  author  believe  inclusionary  zoning  is  bad.  He
          supports community land trusts (CLT). (I find CLTs very very
          expensive for their benefit.)</p></div>

          the natural distribution for demand, we can use it to measure
          the short fall (not enough supply) and the distortion (people
          who buy a larger lot than they want).</p></div>

          250 sqft., but other parts of the code interfere with building

          land required per dwelling unit. In Austin&#8217;s zoning code, these
          requirements differ depending on the zoning district. ... Under

          with a lot of strangers and the residents of a city block (people
          living there and business owners) need to defend themselves
          from strangers. There are 2 ways to do this. One way is to
                                                                          

                                                                          
          demark &#8220;Turfs&#8221; which are patrolled by gangs (in poor areas)
          or private security guards (in rich ones). The alternative is
          an  organic  defense:  the  dangerous  person  is  detected,  the
          alarm communicated to fellow residents, and enough residents
          mass  in  the  street  to  fend  off  the  danger.  This  organic
          defense only comes through visibility of danger, stability of
          residents, communication, building of trust through voluntary
          interactions, and fast response.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The organic defense is encouraged by fostering interaction
          of residents on sidewalks using mixed-use, short blocks, high
          traffic at all hours, recreation in public rather than private,
          etc. You also need big windows looking over street, no blind
          spots, etc.. Parks are bad &#8212; plenty of blind spots, far from
          windows, usually low-traffic. It&#8217;s where gangs fight, where boys
          sneak off to do bad things, and where the homeless gather. A
          few parks, which are small and have traffic at all hours with
          various crowds at different times, are successes. Activity-based
          amenities, like swimming pools (and libraries?), can be good.
          In  addition  to  parks,  other  borders  between  streets,  like
          highways, railroads and rivers, also cut the organic fabric.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter   6&#8217;s   title   says   &#8220;neighborhoods&#8221;   but   means
          &#8220;governing&#8221;.  The  author  doesn&#8217;t  see  a  boundary  for  a
          neighborhood &#8212; the city is a continuous piece of overlapping
          relationships: friends, customers of business, schools, etc.. In
          her mind, there is your block and your city and nothing in
          between. She says there is a political role to be played by
          districts of size about 100,000. Basically, no citywide politician
          cares about your block. You need a district size to be where
          someone on your block can gather enough voices from nearby
          blocks to get the attention of an assemblyman at the city level
          and that the assemblyman has enough power to get stuff done
          with the police, the traffic planners, etc.. She comments that
          many cities are not very democratic because of their structure
          and hoops that residents must try to run through.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Quote  from  pg.  181,  &#8220;Here  is  a  seeming  paradox:  To
          maintain in a neighborhood sufficient people who stay put, a
          city must have the very fluidity and mobility of use ...&#8221;
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I have not read Chapters 7 through 15 yet.
                                                                          

                                                                          
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 15 is about money. There is real damage done
          to  neighborhoods  that  could  not  get  loans  because  banks
          blacklisted them after planners designated them as &#8220;slums&#8221; or
          bad. Existing buildings are not improved; bad buildings are
          not torn down and replaced. Her early example of Boston&#8217;s
          North End is brought up. It was only sustained and improved
          by  people  paying  cash  and  by  construction  people  living
          there. When money does flood into a slum, it often displaces
          residents and destroys the social fabric.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Tax law also drove people to be slumlords. Owners did
          not invest so that profits came as capital gains rather than
          income.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author mentions that eminent domain hurts because
          it  pays  only  for  the  land/building  and  not  everything  the
          owner had invested betting on a stable future. Some cities
          have &#8220;quick-take&#8221; laws that grab the land immediately and
          settle the price later, so that profiteers cannot buy property
          that will be later eminently domained.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 16 is about subsidized housing. The author has
          sharp comments about lack of housing is about lack of money.
          She  recommends  subsidizing  rent  and  guaranteed  loans  to
          building owners who provide it. She would let owners choose
          their residents.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I did not read Chapters 17 through the end.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I didn&#8217;t have time to read all of this book but I want to! It is
          an engaging and eye-opening. The author has new ideas with
          lots of examples. The author never uses the words &#8220;organic
          fabric&#8221;, but that&#8217;s what she means. It&#8217;s a difficult concept
          for  planning  &#8212;  improving  may  require  a  local  &#8220;gardener&#8221;
          rather than a distance mathematical bureaucrat. Even the
          first question that I&#8217;d want to ask, &#8220;how do you measure it?&#8221;,
          is a quandary. Page 174-179 talks about the social network
          in a neighborhood and mentions the number of connections
          between any two people. It&#8217;s a kind of &#8220;six-degrees&#8221; but within
          the neighborhood. Perhaps that&#8217;s a way to measure it. But the
          next question, &#8220;what do planners do to make a neighborhood
          better connected?&#8221; gets even more complex. Even if there&#8217;s
          complexity, the author has redirected everyone&#8217;s gaze at it.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This is a big-thought book about the economic development
          of humanity, like &#8220;Guns, Germs, and Steel&#8221;, by Jane Jacobs.
          She wrote &#8220;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&#8221;
          which is a classic book that upset the world of urban planning.
          This book is fascinating, dense with ideas backed by anecdotes
          from cities. It tries to show that cities are vital to economics
          and a particular process in cities drives economic growth. My
          major problem with it is that it doesn&#8217;t use math. While this
          book is fertile for ideas, its main argument should have use
          the precision and rigor of mathematics to prove its point.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Her  big  idea  is  that  economic  growth  is  driven  by
          &#8220;import  substitution&#8221;  in  cities.  In  her  model  of  a  city,
          it  has  exports,  imports,  export-producing  industry,  and
          (self-)consumption-producing industry. The exports pay for
          the city&#8217;s imports. Growth happens rapidly when a city starts
          producing  goods  that  it  used  to  import.  E.g.,  Tokyo  used
          to import bicycles, but now makes them locally. This new
          industry  increases  the  local  economy  but  also  has  another
          effect. The city&#8217;s exports pay for the imports and now the city
          can buy even more of other imports. These can help the city
          produce more goods that it used to import, causing growth
          and the cycle to happen again. It is that cyclic feedback that
          Jacobs believes drives rapid growth in cities (and economies).
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  book  is  about  more  than  that  idea.  She  believes
          economics  is  about  cities.  (She  points  out  that  industry
          is  not  evenly  spread  across  the  land,  but  concentrated  in
          cities.) That cities pre-date agriculture. (She speculates about
          a city in Turkey trading obsidian before agriculture.) That
          the conventional story if &#8220;agriculture blooms and then cities
          develop&#8221;  is  wrong.  She  says  cities  produce  tools  that  help
          farmers be more productive.
                                                                          

                                                                          
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   She  has  an  organic  view  of  cities.  She  says  cities  that
          focus on mass production in a single industry do not grow
          and develop. She thinks the best cities have an mix of small
          companies which grow and innovate. The book contains many
          stories  about  new  products  being  developed,  such  as  3M
          changing  from  being  a  mining  company  to  making  a  wide
          varies adhesives. She mentioned how Japan learned to make
          bicycles slowly: first repairing bikes, then making their own
          parts to repair bikes, and then, eventually, making the whole
          bike. She tells the story of a factory being set up in a small
          town and it failing, but it succeeded quickly when relocated
          into  a  city.  She  tells  many  stories  of  employees  &#8220;breaking
          away&#8221; to start a new business. She has a great metaphor about
          organic  development  on  pg.  129:  biologists  once  thought  a
          fertilized egg was a tiny baby, only needing to grow larger. We
          now know the egg is a single cell and the fetus develops by
          cells splitting and specializing.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   She has a great set of examples about how geography is
          not destiny. There were other settlements near New York and
          London with better harbors. Those settlements should have
          had the advantage in growth. But they didn&#8217;t. Something else
          drove growth and development.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I  will  say  that  two  of  her  strongest  stories  did  not
          move  me.  They  were  about  the  growth  in  Japan  and  Los
          Angeles after WWII. Both were far away from where they
          imported goods from (USA, East Coast). So, the standard
          economic motivations to move production locally make sense
          &#8212; transportation costs were high (at that time). It would be
          interesting to compare where expensive transportation drives
          local growth and where it does not. In the 1600 to 1900&#8217;s,
          colonies  were  far  away  but  only  some  grew.  Jacob&#8217;s  view
          is that colonies were either focused on single-product mass
          production  or  the  colonizers  prevented  locals  from  making
          imports locally.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   She has disdain for Adam Smith&#8217;s view that specialization
          leads to more production. Smith&#8217;s classic example is the 10
          specialists doing different jobs will make 4,800 pins per day per
          person, and 1 generalist struggles to make a handful. Jacobs
                                                                          

                                                                          
          says  &#8220;Division  of  labor  is  a  device  for  achieving  operating
          efficiency, nothing more.&#8221; (pg. 82). She considers the idea of
          creating the pin in the first place to be the important part.
          Innovation eventually lead to a pin-making machine that put
          all the specialists out of business! She does value the division
          of labor because a 10-step process has 10 (or even 45) places
          where innovation can occur, if allowed.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   For a book from 1969, it feels very predictive of the last
          50 years. She mentions recycling. Investing in startups. That
          services will differentiate and grow faster than manufacturing.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   This is an amazing book because it has lots of stories and
          will get you thinking in new directions. I don&#8217;t accept its story
          of &#8220;import substitution&#8221;, because it is too reductionist. It may
          explain a city&#8217;s growth but not the economy&#8217;s. Doesn&#8217;t import
          substitution mean that manufacturing has moved from the
          exporting city to the importing one, not new manufacturing
          has been created? It might grow the economy if local resources
          are used, but then it is those resources that are causing growth,
          not the movement of the manufacturing.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I do like her view of cities as organic. If we view a city
          as a network of processes, where each takes input goods and
          produces  output  goods,  then  the  network  can  only  change
          by little steps. A process can grow. A process can mutate
          to produce a slightly different product. A process can move
          from outside the city to inside it. A process can split or a
          new process can replicate an existing process. Innovation can
          create a brand new process, but it still has to connect it into
          the network. It helps where there are lots of places to connect
          it to. That may be why cities succeed: not just lots of products
          for customers but lots of places in a network where innovation
          can find a place.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This is a weird book that contains an interesting idea. The
          author,  Jane  Jacobs,  is  a  seasoned  observer  of  cities  and
          wrote <span 
class="cmti-12">the </span>book in Urban Planning, &#8220;The Death and Life of
          Great American Cities&#8221;. In this book, she tries to explain the
          agglomerations effects of cities by exploring the metaphor of
          ecology. That is, that businesses succeed in a vibrant city in
          similar ways to species succeeding in a verdant environment. It
          is an interesting idea. But she doesn&#8217;t explain the idea directly.
          The book written as a sequence of conversations by a handful
          of characters. That&#8217;s weird.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Explaining science using dialog has a long history. The
          Socratic dialogs date to around 400 B.C.. Galileo&#8217;s &#8220;A Dialog
          Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&#8221;, which convinced
          people that the Earth goes around the Sun, was published in
          1632. It can be an interesting informal format, where questions
          and answers go back an forth between an expert and a skeptic.
          Eventually,  the  skeptic  is  won  over  and  so  is  the  reader.
          But, sadly, this book is not in that format. It&#8217;s a handful of
          not-very-well-defined characters talking. It&#8217;s just weird.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   But the idea deserves our consideration. Silicon Valley has
          seen amazing productivity and growth since 1957. Startups
          have thrived there and changed the world. But there&#8217;s nothing
          special about the land there. An Internet-based startup could
          be started anywhere. But that place seems to be different.
          Jane Jacobs thinks it is the ecology of businesses there.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Jane   Jacobs   believes   that   growth   comes   through
          innovation.  Focusing  on  efficiency  can  help  growth,  but
          a  single-company  city  or  a  single-industry  city  is  like  a
          mono-crop. A mono-crop doesn&#8217;t change and A single predator
          or disease can wipe it out. A single-company or single-industry
          city can collapse. Rochester, NY was tied to Kodak&#8217;s rise and
          fall. Detroit to America&#8217;s car industry.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Jane Jacobs sees innovations happening when a process
          mutates into a new process, just as a species mutates into a
          new species. An entrepreneur might first learn to bake bread
          as an employee at a bread shop. Then, spends his savings to
          rent his own bakery. The process of the new baker at the new
                                                                          

                                                                          
          bakery will be slightly different: new products, new ways to
          deliver products, etc. If the new bakery is successful, it will
          grow and hire its own employees, who might go on to start
          their own bakeries.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   But starting a business requires a lot more things than
          know-how and starting capital. A new business needs to find
          suppliers and customers. It needs banks to give mortgages
          or  landlords  who  rent  buildings.  It  needs  lawyers  to  draw
          up founding documents and contracts. This means that new
          processes don&#8217;t arrive in a city, sprung from the forehead of
          an entrepreneur. They usually come by small changes to the
          existing processes in the city. It is far easier for that new baker
          to get started if his previous employer is an ally, introducing
          him to suppliers, advertisers, lawyers, etc.. The new bakery
          would look separate, but it has a lot in common with the old
          bakery.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Some  of  the  small  changes  are:  Replacing  a  supplier.
          Adding a new customer. A slightly different product, tunes to
          specific customers. Growing the process. Making the process
          more efficient. Outsourcing part of the process. Opening a
          new  location  or  moving  to  a  more  advantageous  location.
          Turning waste into a product. (E.g., kitchen oil became &#8220;bio
          diesel&#8221;, waste rags from making clothes became stuffing for
          teddy bears, manure became fuel or fertilizer.) A new delivery
          mechanism.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   A  common  story  of  innovation  is  adding  some  new
          customers,  discovering  that  they&#8217;re  using  the  product  in  a
          new way, making a slightly different product for that group
          of customers, which draws in even more customers who want
          to use the product that way, etc.. After a little while, there&#8217;s
          a  completely  different  product  available  with  a  completely
          separate  group  of  customers.  Jacobs  calls  this  splitting  a
          &#8220;bifurcation&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   But part of the process is brand new companies. Every new
          business needs startup capital. In an ecology, we can think of
          this as the energy stored in eggs and seeds.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  book  has  an  interesting  discussion  of  energy.  Life
          on earth is powered by sunlight. A desert has sunlight. So
                                                                          

                                                                          
          does  a  tropical  forest.  But  only  the  forest  has  lots  of  life.
          Why?  It  seems  the  forest  has  lots  of  small  steps  between
          sunlight being captured and it is used. Plants grow, become
          food for herbivores, which become food for carnivores, which
          die and become food for mushrooms. It wasn&#8217;t clear to me
          what &#8220;energy&#8221; was in the metaphor of business. Maybe it is
          &#8220;demand&#8221;?
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The book talks for some time about feedback cycles. An
          interesting  point  was  that  subsidies  can  cause  unintended
          feedback  cycles.  Cod  was  over-fished,  partially  because
          Canada  subsidized  fisheries.  When  fewer  fish  should  have
          meant  fewer  profits  and  fewer  fisherman,  the  subsidy  kept
          them fishing.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Again, this is a weird book. It was hard to summarize the
          content, because it&#8217;s written as dialog. And it is hard to read
          &#8212; I never did understand who the characters were. But I do
          like the idea that businesses are processes and cities grow by
          lots of little changes to those processes. It might explain why
          innovation is so localized.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This is a good paper. It estimates the price of land around
          Phoenix,  Arizona,  using  transactions  on  vacant  land.  It
          compares those prices to a previous estimate of land under
          buildings. The author&#8217;s goal is to evaluate the use of these
          estimates for land-value taxes.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  authors  start  with  the  prices  of  transactions  on
          vacant  land.  They  use  a  technique  called  &#8220;kriging&#8221;  to
          estimate  the  price  of  land  that  was  not  sold.  In  kriging,
          the estimate of price-per-acre is a weighted average of the
          known price-per-acre for land transactions. The weights are
          a function of distance to the land in the transactions. The
          author tries many ways to calculate weights. They find that
          weighting nearby land more and averaging many pieces of land
          work better. Many techniques for weighting performed about
          the same.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   There are adjustments for the size of the lot, zoning, and

          values track each other closely in the growth rate, but are
          different in the level due to differences in both observable and
          unobservable characteristics&#8221;. Another validation finds similar
          results.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  authors  compare  these  estimates,  calculated  using
          vacant land transactions, to estimates based on a previous
          paper<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Morris2021">15</a>]</span> by the authors (and some additional co-authors).
          That paper used property prices minus the cost to replace the
          building to estimate land values. &#8220;Between 2012 and 2018,
          vacant  land  transactions  generate  land  values  that  are,  on
          average, 14% higher than land underneath structures.&#8221; Vacant
          land  differs  substantially  from  land  under  structures.  It  is
                                                                          

                                                                          
          larger. I spent 30 minutes trying to understanding the graphs
          and the author&#8217;s descriptions here. I didn&#8217;t find them clear.
          And I fear making any summary, since the author seem to give
          up at the end. They say &#8220;the large level differences are not
          due to differences in the option value of redevelopment nor
          teardown costs&#8221; &#8220;unobservable differences are not everywhere
          in  the  city&#8221;  and  &#8220;we  infer  that  there  are  large,  positive,
          unobserved factors that are positively correlated with the size
          of residential lots.&#8221;. It would have been nice to see where in
          the city those were.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The authors discuss how these results would affect a land
          tax. They say, &#8220;Because land is typically the more volatile
          component of a property, a tax exclusively on the value of
          land  would  therefore  be  more  volatile  in  terms  of  revenue
          generated.&#8221; They show big swings where the revenue doubles
          or halves within 6 years. And those are in the only 18 years
          of 1 city covered by this dataset.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I  find  this  paper  very  interesting,  because  land  values
          are important and the prices of vacant lots are handy. (I&#8217;ve
          estimated  price  in  Austin,  TX  using  the  prices  of  vacant
          lots.)  I  wish  the  comparison  between  the  two  techniques
          was  better  written.  The  plots  were  impossible  for  me  to
          comprehend quickly and the description was not enough to
          help. (The paper is short; I wonder if page limits hurt the
          comprehension.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I like the technique of kriging. It&#8217;s simple and fits well
          in the economics toolbox. It is an averaging and it doesn&#8217;t
          capture trends, such as prices increasing as you get closer to
          downtown, so there&#8217;s room for better techniques.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I&#8217;m not surprised that vacant land is more valuable that
          under structures. Vacant land is a very flexible option, because
          it can be subdivided and there&#8217;s a large variety of buildings
          that can be built on it (with time delays). The authors&#8217; other
          technique for valuing land was based on the price of the whole
          property minus the cost of reconstructing the same building.
          That approach (minus the rent for the time to reconstruct the
          building) is a lower-bound for the price of land, because it is
          the profits from a single choice of a very flexible option. And
                                                                          

                                                                          
          exercising that option (having residents move and destroying
          the building) had high friction costs. Given the &#8220;land is an
          option&#8221; approach, its easy to see that swings in future demand
          cause big swings in land prices, because the option can go from
          &#8220;in the money&#8221; to &#8220;out of the money&#8221;. (Urban Economics
          needs a good framework for talking about future demand.)

          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They   use   their   model   to   evaluate   a   vacancy   tax.
          &#8220;Proponents  of  the  tax  argue  that  landlords  who  hold
          storefronts   vacant   impose   unnecessary   costs   on   their
          neighborhoods by reducing local economic activity through
          underutilization of retail space, as well as posing a threat to
          neighborhood safety via a reduction in &#8220;eyes on the street&#8221;
          (Jacobs, 1961). They view the tax as a Pigouvian measure
          which would cause landlords to internalize the impacts of their
          vacancies on urban vibrancy.&#8221;
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   &#8220;We  find  that  the  proposed  commercial  vacancy  tax
          would indeed encourage landlords to fill vacant spaces more
          quickly,  reducing  vacancy  rates  and  retail  rents.  However,
          the  tax  would  also  distort  the  set  of  stores  present,  with
          lower-earnings stores arriving at opportune moments crowding
          out higher-earnings stores that might have arrived later. These
          lower-earnings stores are more likely to exit, increasing retail
          churn and reducing welfare.&#8221;</p></div>

          that there was a rational basis for the law. The California state
          legislature was rational to incentivize people to stay in the
          neighborhood. Another rational basis was that, under Prop
          13, homeowners could predict how much taxes they would owe
          in the future. Using this level of scrutiny, the Court didn&#8217;t
          evaluate how well this law achieve those goals, nor its other
          effects. (The Court assumed the legislature took those into
          consideration and the plaintiff could ask the legislature (rather
          than the Court) to change the law.)

          the lower tax if the residents moved within California and if
          children inherited the property. As Nordlinger already lived in
          California as a renter before buying the home, they were not
          allowed to argue that these terms were unfair to out-of-state
          buyers. Another plaintiff would need to bring that case.

          taxpayers into classes, but it wasn&#8217;t by any rational scheme
          but by the purchase price of the property, irrelevant of time.
          He also thought the &#8220;rational basis&#8221; had to serve all taxpayers
          and the rational that this law served newer homeowners (and
          people wanting to buy homes) was close to absurd. He also
          thought that, by allowing inheriting children to keep the lower
          tax, it was a tax-break based on heritage.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >The book starts pretty boring. Chapter 2 is a discussion of the
          various definitions of &#8220;homeless&#8221;. For example, are people in
          a shelter &#8220;homeless&#8221;? Chapter 3 is an undramatic discussion
          of why homelessness is bad for other people. Strangely, for an
                                                                          

                                                                          
          economist, it doesn&#8217;t try to put it in financial terms. Chapter
          4 is a history of homelessness and data for it. Which is pretty
          awful, up to 1996.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 5 is interesting: it compares the homeless, who
          sleep  outdoors  or  in  shelters,  to  what  most  people  call
          &#8220;homeless&#8221;,  the  people  that  beg,  collect  cans,  and  wash
          windshields.  He  refers  to  those  as  &#8220;colloquially  homeless&#8221;
          or &#8220;daytime streetpeople&#8221; or simply &#8220;streetpeople&#8221;. There is
          overlap. The author&#8217;s study in New York said about 3/4 of
          streetpeople are homeless, but 1/4 live with someone or have
          their own place. Most have slept in a shelter but do not like
          them. The streetpeople earn a variable income that is below
          minimum  wage.  Those  that  reported  hours  worked  around
          7 hours a day. 2/3 work 7 days a week; the rest are evenly
          split between 1 and 6 days a week. 3/4 say they would take
          a low-wage job. About 1/2 get public assistance, which might
          go away with a job. If given extra money, about 1/3 said they
          would spend it on alcohol or drugs. 2/3 said they didn&#8217;t have
          a way to save money!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 6 describes an economic model of housing and
          homelessness,  without  any  equations.  But  it  uses  phrases
          like  &#8220;price-quality  schedule&#8221;,  so  good  luck  understanding
          the  chapter  without  an  advanced  econ  degree.  I  have
          one  and,  for  me,  it  might  have  been  easier  with  some
          equations. The model has a high-end market, where houses
          are  built  and  maintained,  a  low-end  market,  where  houses
          are not maintained and deteriorate in quality, and, finally,
          homelessness.  The  interesting  part  is  the  low-end  market,
          where changes in costs ripple down determine who is homeless.
          It is a model of a market at equilibrium and the author walks
          through various scenarios that will change the equilibrium.
          They&#8217;re summarized in Table 6-1 at the end of the chapter.
          It is a well-constructed model but I&#8217;m not sure how well it
          represents reality. Buildings take decades to age, so are cities
          actually near equilibrium? Also, the
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 7 looks at the effect of income inequality. The
          author uses an unusual metric: the slope of a line fitted to
          the lower-half of an income histogram. Yeah. Very unusual.
                                                                          

                                                                          
          He  leaves  out  a  lot  of  details.  He  claims  that  it  explains
          homelessness  very  well,  &#8220;allowing  for  lags&#8221;  (pg.  132).  But
          what is an appropriate amount of &#8220;lag&#8221;? Increases in the price
          of low-rent housing predicts homelessness. On page 142 he
          starts a history of very low-rent housing. Every place has a
          different name and regulation for them: flop houses, SROs,
          cubicle hotels, etc. Many closed due to profitability in the
          early 80&#8217;s. Some had high vacancies. It&#8217;s not clear why that
          explains anything. He uses fire reports and demolition records
          but I don&#8217;t find the data and/or story compelling.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 8 looks at financial influences on housing. Interest
          rates  and  inflation  are  too  small  to  affect  operating  costs
          in his model. The opportunity cost of land (which he calls
          &#8220;gentrification&#8221;). This didn&#8217;t explain homelessness in the 80&#8217;s,
          but it might now in Austin and San Francisco.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 9 examines other studies that compare multiple
          cities  against  each  other.  It  includes  Tucker  1987,  Tucker
          1987b, Quigley 1990, Elliot and Krivo 1991, Burt 1992, and
          Honig  and  Filer  1993.  He  doesn&#8217;t  like  their  data!  There
          are  different  definition  of  metro-area:  Census  Bureau  and
          Rand-McNally.  Pg.  167  has  some  insights:  &#8220;wealthier  cites
          should provide more shelter, since charity is a normal good,
          and  so  should  cities  with  more  valuable  real  estate,  since
          removing homeless people from such real estate yields a higher
          return&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter  10  covers  government.  &#8220;New  York  has  not
          prevented the construction of shanties, but has confined their
          construction to the most primitive technology.&#8221; And, now,
          Austin  has  confined  people  to  tents.  He  mentioned  that
          health regulations may include window size, ventilation, and
          minimum floor area to limit the spread of TB. He says that
          regulations may be needed to keep buildings maintained: the
          owner going bankrupt will not profit from maintenance (the
          bank  will)  and  may  not  maintain  the  building.  He  notes
          a distinction between &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; regulation, where the
          existing uncompliant are legalized, and &#8220;retrofit&#8221; regulations,
          which requires owners to invest to meet the standard. Owners
          of grandfathered buildings have &#8220;something valuable &#8212; an
                                                                          

                                                                          
          exemption  from  regulation&#8221;.  NYC  banned  SROs,  but  the
          author doesn&#8217;t think it affected homelessness. One argument
          is high vacancy rates. One cost is parking spaces, even if the
          law  only  requires  1  for  every  6  rooms.  Low-cost  landlords
          suffer  from  capricious  enforcement  of  rules.  Rent  control
          means owners do not invest in maintenance and that owners
          discriminate on residents (rather than price), which may mean
          the unhoused are &#8220;lemons&#8221; that the landlords don&#8217;t want.
          Making  evictions  harder  hurts  low-cost  landlords,  because
          more  tenants  are  disruptive  and  fewer  can  pay  (or  have
          seizable assets) to make up for the eviction costs. &#8220;A former
          SRO owner in Newark, for instances, gave as his main reason
          for  leaving  the  business  the  hassle  and  liability  that  had
          become part of it; he thought that the only persons who would
          buy a cheap hotel now was the &#8217;thickest-skinned SOB in the
          world&#8217;.&#8221;. O&#8217;Flaherty thinks tenants rights contributed high
          vacancy and, a small amount, to homelessness. He believes
          &#8220;public housing for the middle class increases homelessness;
          ... for the very poor, reduces it.&#8221;. 1/3 of homeless women in a
          shelter said they wouldn&#8217;t live in Chicago public housing due
          to the lack of safety.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He  says  Section  8  has  a  certificate,  which  pays  the
          difference  between  actual  rent  and  30%  of  income,  and  a
          voucher, which pays the difference between &#8220;fair market rent&#8221;
          and  30%  of  income.  Those  with  voucher  still  need  their
          residence  checked  by  the  housing  authority!  Why?!  Food
          stamp  funds  increase  with  rent,  so  it&#8217;s  a  rental  assistance
          program! WTF?!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Rental vacancy was studied by Rosen and Smith 1983 and
          Arnott 1989. Vacancy is complicated. Pairing a landlord with
          a  tenant  is  a  two-sided  process.  Landlords  decide  the  rent
          and also how much to advertise and any renter requirements.
          Tenants decide their price limits, where to search, how much to
          search, and how much effort to meet landlords&#8217; requirements.
          Vacancy around 7% or 9% is &#8220;natural&#8221;. O&#8217;Flaherty doesn&#8217;t
          think vacancy explain homelessness.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 11 is about welfare (&#8221;income maintenance&#8221;) in
          wealthy countries. New York&#8217;s General Assistance encouraged

          up <span 
class="cmti-12">and </span>hard to stay on the list. &#8220;one chance in eight of opening
          a  case  and  maintaining  it  for  a  year.&#8221;  System  is  complex
          and  time-consuming.  Making  and  keeping  appointments  is
          difficult for homeless. Many homeless seek independence and
          avoid hassle. Mental health and disability determinations are
          hard and bureaucratic. (They&#8217;re medical decisions in Canada.)
          Programs  incentivize  black-market  work,  like  begging  and
          cleaning windshields, because official job income reduces their
          income from SSI or other programs. The &#8220;tax&#8221; is 100% for
          New York&#8217;s general assistance.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Under  sharing  housing,  the  author  says  social  security
          (SSI) and foot stamps have &#8220;strong disincentives for sharing
          housing&#8221;. SSI reduces by 1/3. Foodstamps give more for 2
          people living apart than living together. This programs were
          growing rapidly in the 1970s, before homelessness took off in
          the 1980s!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 12 is about mental health. The chapter looks at
          the release of people from mental hospitals in the 1960s and
          says that was unlikely to be a cause of homelessness later.
          Some women make themselves dirty and act crazy to scare off
          attackers. For low-cost housing where people shared rooms,
          a few people with mental health problems has a large effect.
          Also, repair costs and liability go up. Many have &#8220;innkeeper
          liability&#8221;, which means the law blames them for bad guests
          causing problems to other guests! There may be a tipping
          point, where enough mentally ill poison all low-cost housing,
          but the author finds little evidence for it.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 13 is about drugs. Taking drugs is a choice and
          the author sweetly says, &#8220;Volition means economics.&#8221; He says
          crack became popular because it is cheap. (Powdered cocaine
          was  sold  by  gram;  crack  by  1/20th  of  a  gram.)  Different
          drugs are substitutes and crack displaced powdered cocaine
          and amphetamines. Maybe alcohol too. But crack is not a
          substitute for housing! Cheaper highs mean that more money
          is left for housing. Housing demand should have increased!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   But that analysis skips a lot, such as the lost productive
                                                                          

                                                                          
          hours of someone who gets high and the instability of highs
          and  lows  (which  causes  people  to  lose  jobs).  And  maybe
          other changes? Drugs and alcohol are common among shelter
          residents. Half took cocaine in one study. Cocaine use did spike
          in the 1980s. Cirrhosis deaths spiked in the 1970s ... why? The
          timing of homelessness doesn&#8217;t really line up with emergency
          room visits. The author concludes that &#8220;at least as good an
          argument can be made that crack reduced homelessness as
          that it increased homelessness.&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter  14  is  about  cops  and  prisons.  Many  homeless
          have been in jail (31%) or prison (18%). Homelessness doesn&#8217;t
          cause people to go to prison, but releases of prisoners increases
          homelessness.  They  have  a  hard  time  getting  work,  may
          have a harder time finding a place to rent, and have fewer
          social connections to help. Prisoner releases didn&#8217;t cause the
          problems in the 1980&#8217;s, but maybe contribute today? Common
          laws used against homeless are: loitering (unconstitutional),
          vagrancy (unconstitutional), obstructing sidewalks, begging,
          public drinking or drunkenness, and commitment to mental
          institutions. Police are usually sympathetic to the homeless:
          they have to deal with them regularly, there&#8217;s little benefit
          in conflict, and the police like support from other institutions
          who might react negatively if they abuse the homeless. Police
          just  displace  the  homeless,  not  fix  things.  Homeless  might
          prefer jail, with warmth and food. We don&#8217;t have much data
          on Black homelessness during the 1950&#8217;s and 1960&#8217;s, but it
          increased in 1970&#8217;s. Why? The author mentions less racism,
          but doesn&#8217;t mention migration, which happened then.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 15 is the author&#8217;s diagnosis and prescription. He
          thinks  homelessness  in  NYC  in  the  1980&#8217;s  was  caused  by
          the  &#8220;middle  class  shrinking&#8221;  (income  distribution  changes)
          in the 1970&#8217;s. His model predicts that less low-cost housing
          was provided. Also contributing were zoning regulations, strict
          housing-maintenance  laws,  difficulty  evicting  tenants,  more
          ex-prisoners, and more generous shelters. Low priced crack
          may have helped end homelessness. Newark&#8217;s story is similar.
          Chicago didn&#8217;t see a shift in the income distribution and didn&#8217;t
          see homelessness. He waves his hands with Toronto. He dodges
                                                                          

                                                                          
          with London and Hamburg. In fact, he goes so far as to say
          &#8220;perhaps maintenance is cheap relative to construction so that
          the models of Chapter 6 don&#8217;t apply.&#8221;!!! This is my biggest
          problem with his model: how does he know it works at all?
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   His  policy  recommendations  are:  Do  not  discriminate
          against  or  in  favor  of  the  homeless.  E.g.,  different  welfare
          payments,  access  to  services,  etc..  The  police  should  focus
          on crime, not anti-social behavior. This includes prosecuting
          crimes against the homeless and crimes by the homeless. He
          says police should do &#8220;aggressive but non-punitive referral&#8221;
          but I&#8217;m not sure what that means. Right after, he talks about
          the Port Authority bus terminal and Grand Central terminal
          being  clear  of  homeless.  He  says  that  the  homeless  should
          <span 
class="cmti-12">not </span>be allowed to build shanties, because they&#8217;re unsafe and
          violate the law.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Cities should not run shelters; they should hand out an
          allowance and let private companies run shelters. Shelters will
          then compete to be the preferred place and improve services
          to the homeless. (Cities may run shelters for natural disasters,
          etc.) Private shelters should be allowed to offer better rooms
          for cash on top of the allowance, creating a working market
          for low-cost housing. (NOTE: In Austin, there is probably a
          huge discontinuity between a free bed in a shelter and <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>700 for
          an apartment!) The author prefers entitlements, because they
          provide predictability for everyone. For disruptive homeless
          people, which private shelters will not house for the allowance,
          he  recommends  selectively  increasing  the  allowance.  &#8220;This
          scheme won&#8217;t work perfectly ... but I can think of no scheme
          that  would  work  better.&#8221;  (NOTE:  Let  charities  deal  with
          them?) Later, on page 289, he says &#8220;A commitment to zero
          homelessness is unworkable&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He describes public housing rules as giving &#8220;authorities a
          choice between running empty buildings and running buildings
          full of fairly well-off people&#8221;. A study says that for every <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>2
          spent on public housing, residents would pay only <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>1 for it.
          His non-discrimination policy says that homeless should <span 
class="cmti-12">not</span>
          move to the front of the queue for public housing. He also says
          that there shouldn&#8217;t be a waiting list for public housing &#8212; it
                                                                          

                                                                          
          should be a random draw of all applicants! (Waiting longer
          doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;more deserving&#8221;.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   As   for   regulations,   he   doesn&#8217;t   like   &#8220;apex   zoning&#8221;
          (&#8221;hierarchical zoning&#8221;, I believe). It should be easy to evict
          for any reason (not just &#8220;good cause&#8221;). He points out that
          eviction takes time and money and, for poor residents, putting
          a lien on their possessions won&#8217;t pay for it. (NOTE: Does
          this mean that it would be a good policy to pay landlords for
          evictions, as a form of insurance?) He says we should remove
          &#8220;innkeeper liability&#8221; for lodginghouses and SROs; they should
          have the same liability as apartments. (NOTE: I&#8217;m not sure I
          agree with this; I think allowing eviction for any reason would
          help fix this.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He says working homeless are good, because busy people
          cause fewer problems than welfare clients. He suggests finding
          productive work, paid in cash, in small amounts quickly. He
          suggest  paying  for  each  small  piece  of  work.  He  suggests
          getting rid of the disincentives in assistance plans. He suggests
          hiring should be informal and without any eligibility criteria.
          His example of a good program is &#8220;Street News&#8221; newspaper in
          Chicago and recycling cans in NYC. He suggests discouraging
          begging by allowing charities, like Salvation Army, to solicit
          on the streets!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He suggests getting rid of the disincentives for doubling
          up  in  SSI  and  foodstamps.  He  suggests  reducing  effective
          marginal tax rates. For drug abusers, he says we should make
          it easier for them to get money like SSI. He suggests disability
          should be more than yes-no proposition, but have degrees.
          Lastly, US programs need to be as friendly and accessible as
          Canadian ones.</p></div>

          equilibrium&#8221;, by which the author means how everyone in the
          housing market reacts to a policy. A shelter is more pleasant
          than sleeping rough, so more shelters means that fewer will
          sleep rough and, also, that some people will stay longer. So,
          Housing First treats the homeless, but there aren&#8217;t studies on
          what it does to the system.

          Australians beyond homelessness. It produced a lot of good

          homelessness.  Women  experienced  trauma  while  homeless.
          Violence  might  cause  male  homelessness,  but  not  female.
          Addiction,  in  general,  was  not  a  cause  of  homelessness.
          Although heavy alcohol use (a binge) might be causal.

          with averages or the near-homeless didn&#8217;t apply for EITC.

          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   NYC ran a service &#8220;Homebase&#8221; which prioritized treated
          people in their neighborhoods. I&#8217;m not sure all the details, but
          it kept social connections.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Prevention is tricky. Rolston et al. found 14.5% of their
          control  group  entered  shelters  and  8.0%  of  the  treatment
          group. Since only 6.5% were affected, the program could be
          expensive for the effect.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   People have private information on how likely they are to
          be homeless. Still, practitioners may find it hard to get honest
          answers  when  the  treatment  depends  on  the  answer.  The
          Homebase program saw evidence with long walks to services.
          The NYC housing program does it by requiring long stays at
          a shelter before getting housing support.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   In NYC, homelessness increased from 2011 to 2017, but the
          housing market was mostly unchanged. Vacancy in low-rent
          apartments fell by 1/3, but it was not significant. Migration
          doesn&#8217;t explain shifts in numbers, even in the NY/NJ area.
          LA saw a similar rise in the city but not surrounding areas.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Under Mayor De Blasio, NYC raised <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>-per-family-day from
          <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>103 to <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>171. (NYC sometimes rents hotel rooms and that&#8217;s
          close to the price of one.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   On page 62, does a &#8220;thought experiment&#8221; of how many
          Housing Choice Vouchers would be necessary to replace NYC&#8217;s
          shelters and other programs. He believes the money currently
          spent (<span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>1.8 billion) might be able to do it. Pg. 66 says LA&#8217;s
                                                                          

                                                                          
          survey is different from NYC in major ways. E.g., visual not
          interviews. No transit. Non-random. Crappy in every way.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   LA spends far less on homeless services: 1/15th that of
          NYC! That rose to about 1/3 in 2017. &#8220;prevention in Los
          Angeles might also require <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>30,000 to reduce the PIT Count
          by 1&#8221;. Wow. He compares that to rent subsidies, which in
          NYC, cost <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>40,000 to <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>80,000 to reduce the PIT Count by 1.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Economists have not studied the unsheltered homeless. Is
          the difference between cities a matter of enforcement?
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Veterans saw a big decrease in homelessness from 2010 to
          2016. But the age range for high homelessness (18 to 64) also
          fell sharply. There was a large voucher program (HUD-VASH)
          but it may have had little effect.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Homeless families fell by 2/3s between 2010 and 2017. It
          could be because NY state takes kids from homeless families
          and other states copied that. There are other possibilities.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Black people are more likely to be homeless, but states
          with  more  Black  residents  tend  to  have  fewer  homeless.
          Drug rates, alcohol abuse, and mental illness are the same
          rate in Blacks as in other groups. The proportion of Black
          incarcerated  is  similar  to  those  homeless.  The  author  says
          another candidate explanation is segregation: a shelter full
          of Black people may be off-putting to White people. (But
          wouldn&#8217;t  that  push  up  the  number  of  unsheltered  White
          homeless?)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  conclusion  says:  &#8220;We  don&#8217;t  know  how  to  end
          homelessness.&#8221; &#8220;We can&#8217;t explain why homelessness in the
          two biggest American cities exploded in this decade, or why
          it fell in the rest of the country.&#8221; &#8220;On an aggregate level,
          weather, labor market conditions, and housing prices affect
          homelessness, and maybe policies too, but modest changes in
          unemployment or rents cannot be expected to trigger huge
          changes in homelessness.&#8221; &#8220;...; for the most effective policies a
          handful or two of people have to be treated to reduce aggregate
          homelessness by one.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s a good time for more economists
          to start working on homelessness.&#8221;</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >I  read  this  paper  quickly.  It&#8217;s  a  simple  concept  and  a
          well-written paper. An easy read.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   This paper looks at the hard problem of making sure there
          are lots of <span 
class="cmti-12">many </span>sizes available for construction in a city. It is
          easy to divide a large lot into many pieces. But, once done, it is
          hard to aggregate lots of small lots into a large lot again. How
          does a city keep a set of large lots available for development?
          The author&#8217;s answer is to give the financial incentive of more
          density for larger lots.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The concept is pretty simple. Write the zoning laws so
          that larger lots can build taller and denser. This incentivizes
          owners of small lots to collaborate to create larger lots.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author has an example from Simi Valley, California.
          The incentives allowed 18 single-family lots to be voluntarily
          grouped  together  and  redeveloped  as  a  master-planned
          community. One owner refused to sell; 3 others only sold part
          of their land. The sellers had a single realtor. According to
          the realtor, &#8220;the developer paid the land price expected for
          development at seven units per acre. The original owners thus
          captured most of the capital gains from the higher density&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author has some interesting comments. It is voluntary,
          so avoids the problems associated with eminent domain. After
          passing graduated density, neighborhoods remain the same;
          neighborhoods only change when lots are assembled. Owners
          may sell their land for fear-of-missing-out.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I do worry about the balance. The goal is to have many lots
          of many sizes. This law may tend towards the largest possible.
          E.g., imagine 4 lots on a block and two agree to merge. If those
          2 are in the middle, will the others almost have to join now?
          If those 2 are on the end, will the other 2 have an incentive to
          join to make 2 pair or join the already merging lots to make
          it 3 or 4 lots together?
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I don&#8217;t have time now, but would like to think more about
          the market solutions. If there&#8217;s a shortage, won&#8217;t larger lots
                                                                          

                                                                          
          command a higher price? That should provide incentives to
          sell. If we need many land owners to sell together, is there
          a way to form a legal entity that they participate in? E.g.,
          create an adhoc corporation with certain bidding rules and a
          way to overrule holdouts? I feel like I need to be convinced
          that this is a real problem and that this is the best solution.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   This  is  a  short,  easy  read.  It  is  a  good  subject  and  a
          solution worth talking about and considering.</p></div>
