          <p class="bibitem-p" >I   skimmed   this   paper.   The   paper   compares   the   rent
          component of the CPI to two other rent indexes, Zillow&#8217;s ZORI
          and the Marginal Rent Index. The other indexes jumped up
          quickly and the CPI didn&#8217;t and that scared BLS.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The paper&#8217;s answer is that CPI measures the rent being
          paid now and the other indexes measure the rent on a newly
          signed contract. The contract, obviously, last 1 or 2 years so
          &#8221;the rent paid now&#8221; in the middle of the contract doesn&#8217;t
          match the rent on newly signed contracts. Thus, ZORI leads

          <p class="bibitem-p" >Estimated  the  value  of  land  under  American  cities  using
          68,756  land  transactions.  The  paper  gets  pretty  mathy  at
          points and I didn&#8217;t understand what they were doing. But,
          at  its  core,  it  is  a  hedonic  regression.  It  has  choices  that
          I  wouldn&#8217;t  make.  They  do  cross-validate  their  results.  I
          wish  they  reported  error  bounds  on  their  numbers  &#8212;  the
          price-per-acre in the center of the city is exponentially higher
          than average, so errors are magnified dramatically. They don&#8217;t
          look at the time series, to see if a change in any factor (like
          center-city prices) indicates a future change (like residential
          prices).
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Separated  samples  by  MSA,  or  primary  MSA.  Defined
          the &#8221;city center&#8221; to be City Hall or Mayor&#8217;s office. (That&#8217;s
          a   problem   in   NYC!   I  would   have   chosen   the   tallest
          building.)  Some  MSAs  have  multiple  city  centers  (like
          Minneapolis-St.Paul).  Land  is  associated  with  the  closest
          center. (That&#8217;s bad when a larger one dominates.) I don&#8217;t like
          that they don&#8217;t search for the center of the city and don&#8217;t try
          to discover more &#8221;centers&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   It  uses  hedonic  regression.  Log(land  price)  is  a  linear
          function  based  on  distance  from  the  city  center  and  other
          factors.  Distance  is  the  natural  log  of  1  +  the  Euclidean
          distance in miles. The distance constant varies by city. The
          intercept varies by city and year. The linear function is also
          adjusted for lot size and proposed used, which can vary by
          time. Figure 1 shows a plot from Houston and the linear model
          seems like a good fit. When they allow multiple powers of their
          distance function in the linear regression, there is a higher
          peak downtown and a flattening of the rest of the graph.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They  have  little  data  and  do  some  math  to  create  an
          average city of a given area. I&#8217;m not sure how this works. They
          do a similar thing with changes over time.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   To estimate the value of the whole city, they use their
          function to predict the price at the centroid of each census
          tract. Then they sum all the tracts in the city.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They find that larger cities have a higher intercept (central
          land  value).  Larger  cities  have  a  steeper  slope.  There  is
          much variation here, but the trend is for large cities to have
                                                                          

                                                                          
          downtown values that are 7 times those 10 miles away. For
          smaller cities, the value is 1, meaning no change in land value
          from downtown to 10 miles away. The average land value for
          cities is pretty flat.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   As  for  intended  use,  &#8221;Retail,  apartment,  mixed  use,
          and medical proposed uses have substantially higher values,
          while commercial, industrial, and multifamily uses have lower
          values.&#8221;  I&#8217;m  not  sure  how  &#8221;multifamily&#8221;  is  different  from
          &#8221;apartment&#8221;. It doesn&#8217;t list single-family, but the appendix
          says it is near zero.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The highest central land values are NY, Chicago, D.C., San
          Francisco, and Los Angeles-Long Beach. The steepest price
          slope goes to Chicago and then Washington D.C.. The flattest
          expensive cities are San Jose and Orange County, CA. The
          higher average land values tend to be on the coast. (Why?)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Total land value is NYC at <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>2.5T, LA at <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>2.3T, then SF,
          D.C., and Chicago. They account for 48% of all urban land
          value. The total value for the USA in 2010 was <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>19.1T. An
          alternate way of measuring, &#8221;Flow of Funds&#8221;, put it at <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>6.2T.
          It only measures private land and covers the whole country;
          this paper&#8217;s method covers all of cities, including roads, parks,
          etc..
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Over time, the land value drops 40% after the Financial
          Crisis. The Case-Shiller index drops 19%. Their values don&#8217;t
          line up with the stock market&#8217;s movements at the time.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >Focuses on William A. Niskanen&#8217;s theory that bureaucrats

          can be measured by looking at City Managers who contract
          outside.  When  going  outside,  the  price  is  visible  to  their
          &#8221;polical sponsor&#8221;. So, if City Managers contract outside more
          than other top city officials, it validates the theory.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Concludes: &#8221;City manager cities are slightly more likely to
          contract out. This general pattern of contracting out is more
          in line with the professionalism in government hypothesis than
          the greedy bureaucrat hypothesis.&#8221;</p></div>

          covered for 80% of losses <span

          for by a tax on all homeowners in the neighborhood.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   99 houses bought insurance in the first 4 months. This
          number rose to 1500. But it had fallen to around 150 by the
          year 2000. Insurance was not popular because it insured only
          the neighborhood, not movement in city or nation-wide home
          prices.  Also,  doing  a  proper  sale  to  claim  the  payout  was
          onerous.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   At the time, insurance inspired confidence that a &#8221;bank

          <p class="bibitem-p" >Skimmed this paper.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   It  is  reportedly  a  landmark  paper  (first  paper?)  in
          measuring agglomeration effects. That is, that productivity is
          increased when we have a lot of people near each other.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   It focuses on counties. It assumes productivity increases
          multiplicatively with density. I skipped a lot of math in its
          model. Workers have a preference for low-density locations,
          which  prevents  everyone  from  moving  to  a  single  city  and
          being super-productive. Page 59 and 60 mention land prices,
          but I&#8217;m not sure it is in the model.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Data was labor input, that excluded the self-employed. It
          came from the Regional Economic Measurement Division of
          the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. They excluded data
          from  states  where  mining  was  more  than  15%  of  output:
          Alaska, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They adjust density with education, state-wide effects, and
          population of county (without taking into account its area).
          Education has a big effect, but the others do not.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The result is that doubling density is correlated with an
          increasing labor productivity by 6%.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I&#8217;d need to read the paper in detail to figure out what
          this  really  means.  That  is,  that  the  number  does  capture
                                                                          

                                                                          
          productivity. And figure out how land prices work into this. I
          don&#8217;t like that it is on a county basis &#8212; that&#8217;s such a large
          scale that it is surprising to see any effect. My data on land
          prices in Austin shows that prices change dramatically in a
          few blocks; Travis County is many many block-widths across.
          If density increases exponentially as we get to the center of
          Austin, the average density of Travis County doesn&#8217;t measure
          that peak. What I&#8217;m saying is that we need good find-detail
          data for measuring cities.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >The authors felt that the press, public, and even policy makers
          had  a  mistaken  view  of  the  causes  of  homelessness.  They
          wanted to present simple plots of data showing that many
          commonly discussed &#8221;causes&#8221; are not the cause. And that the
          price of housing was.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Page 13 and 14 have a great metaphor: musical chairs. A
          person with a cast doesn&#8217;t get a seat, but it isn&#8217;t because he
          cannot get to a chair. It is because there is 1 fewer chairs
          than people. Such is homelessness &#8212; we see a lot of individual
          factors (mental health, addiction, race, etc.) that affect who
          doesn&#8217;t gets a home, but we need to look at citywide factors
          that cause a home shortage.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  data  is  strange.  They  want  to  use  the  35  largest
          cities  by  metro  area.  (Why  35??)  They  drop  6  because
          HUD&#8217;s Continuity of Care (CoC) region covers &#8221;too large a
          geographic area&#8221;. The dropped cities are Houston, Riverside
          (CA), Denver, Orlando, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City (MO).
          The rest are split into two groups, where the CoC matches the
          city (20 of them) or the county (10 of them). Chicago appears
          in both groups. They cover years 2007 to 2019, but admit that
          the PIT Count (their measure of homelessness) is iffy in some
                                                                          

                                                                          
          cities and especially in the early few years.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Over time, homelessness has dropped on average. But the
          variance has increased.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They talk about the PIT Count (&#8221;homeless census&#8221;). Most
          homelessness is temporary, but some is long-term. Because the
          PIT Count is a single day, it emphasizes the long-term. If it
          was people over the year, the temporary ones would show up
          more.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Homeless   are   more   likely   to   be:   male,   unmarried,
          low-income,  old,  non-white,  and  queer.  They  are  socially
          isolated:  fewer  family  ties  and  far  from  family.  They  are
          more likely to be depressed, mentally ill, abused drugs, abuse
          alcohol,  have  a  conviction  and  been  incarcerated.  70%  are
          individuals,  usually  male.  30%  are  families,  which  tend  to
          undergo temporary homelessness.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Cost per homeless is <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>30,000 to <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>100,000 for government
          services.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The book has good data on poverty, which is negatively
          correlated  with  homelessness.  Unemployment  is  negatively
          correlated with homelessness. It is odd that they plot data
          points  for  every  year  and  don&#8217;t  estimate  fixed-effects  for
          cities. (E.g., does an increase in poverty cause an increase in
          homelessness?)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Mental   illness   and   drug   use   are   measured   on   a
          statewide-basis. That seems to large a scale.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Race  is  negatively  correlated  with  homelessness.  Black
          people are more likely to be homeless, but cities with more
          Black residents have a lower rate of homelessness!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Temperature  is  handled  badly.  They  use  the  average
          temperature for the month of January ... even though the
          PIT Count was on a specific day? The county data shows no
          correlation of warmer winters with homelessness, but the city
          data does. They fight that result by combining the data using
          &#8221;indexed homelessness&#8221; (described on pages 20 to 22) which is,
          let&#8217;s say, not a well-known technique. The annedotal evidence
          &#8212; that cold NYC has more homeless than warm southern
          cities &#8212; is much stronger than their data.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They   admit   that   temperature   is   correlated   with
                                                                          

                                                                          
          unsheltered homeless. They explain that this may be because
          cold cities spend more on shelter than warmer cities, which
          may spend on outdoor services.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Generous  social  services  is  also  done  differently.  It
          measures  the  state&#8217;s  maximum  TANF  (&#8221;Welfare&#8221;)  benefit
          against  family  homelessness  rate.  It  uses  families,  because
          individuals rarely qualify for TANF. This does not seem like
          a good measure.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The   show   that   low-income   migration   is   negatively
          correlated with homelessness. They try to say this shows the
          cities with high homelessness are not &#8221;welfare magnets&#8221;. To
          me, that data means other things.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They  handle  political  party  annecdotally,  citing  that
          Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland are highly Democratic cities
          with  low  homelessness.  The  authors  inveigh  against  harsh
          police treatment of the homeless and say there is no evidence
          that it does more than hide the problem.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They do a strange interlude to look at cost-burden-ness as
          a cause of homelessness. They find when the median person
          spend more on housing, homelessness goes down in cities. But
          not in counties. And the result doesn&#8217;t hold when looking at
          the &#8221;first-quartile housing cost burden&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   What should be the finale is the comparison of median
          rent, vacancy, first-quartile rent, and &#8221;first-quartile vacancy&#8221;
          (vacancy in lowest 1/4 rent apartments). Rent and vacancy
          are inversely correlated and both predict homelessness. The
          strongest is median rent which has an R-squared of 55% for
          cities and first-quartile rent which has an R-squared of 28%
          for counties. (For vacancy, they regress against log(vacancy),
          which is a strange choice since both homeless rate and vacancy
          are on a scale of 0 to 100%. They don&#8217;t apply log to rent, where
          it would be more natural. And they don&#8217;t do log(vacancy)
          when showing it correlates with rent. These are inconsistent
          strange choices.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Page 134 says that they did a full model with fixed-city
          effects ... but don&#8217;t show its results. Not even in an appendix.
          WTF.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The rest of the book doesn&#8217;t follow their thesis. They see if
                                                                          

                                                                          
          growth is correlated with homelessness and find it isn&#8217;t. They
          mention a study shows that inequality is causal ... but say it
          isn&#8217;t in their data (without any plots).
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   They  eventually  say  that  economics  believe  supply  is
          limited  by  geography  (oceans,  mountains,  etc.)  and  by
          regulation. They then group cities by elasticity (a measure
          of supply limitations) and growth. (So, now, they&#8217;re saying
          growth <span 
class="cmti-12">does </span>matter.) And the worst cities have high growth
          and low elasticity. I expected the book to end here saying &#8221;we
          need to fix the regulation in high-growth cities&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   But,  no.  We  get  38  pages  of  their  vague  plan  to  fix
          homelessness. After a data-driven book focused on proving one
          point, it is huge jumble of opinion at the finish. They dismiss
          filtering without a citation on page 134. They put together a
          mushy argument against markets on pages 171 to 173. They
          say private markets won&#8217;t create houses for people with no
          income, but ignore the idea of giving money to those people.
          After  citing  economists  ealier,  they  say  &#8221;housing  must  be
          de-commodified&#8221;. They mention that building houses has not
          come down in price like building iPhones, but don&#8217;t mention
          that most cities ban manufactured homes on most land. It
          goes on: public perception, funding, and more. Way too much
          for a single chapter.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  book&#8217;s  data  is  passable  &#8212;  it  is  clear  enough  to
          make most of their thesis&#8217;s points &#8212; but I think it needs a
          much stronger analysis in an appendix. The book never really
          addressed how to handle correlations in data samples from
          the same city in different years. The writing began well but it
          totally flubbed the landing. The last chapter should have been
          cut and become the basis for the author&#8217;s next book. But it did
          well enough to make its point and that&#8217;s an accomplishment.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This is a very good article. I dislike the author&#8217;s conclusion,
          but  the  article  identifies  a  problem  and  marshalls  a  lot
          of  data  to  demonstrate  it.  The  author  attacks  the  idea
          that goverment should protect housing as an investvestment.
          Making  money  on  housing  is  mostly  about  luck.  &#8221;price
          appreciation accounts for roughly 86 percent of the wealth
          associated with owning a home.&#8221; Government housing policy
          is  &#8221;built  on  a  contradiction&#8221;.  Politicians  announce  higher
          house  prices  as  a  good  thing,  but  it  is  obviously  hurting
          people  trying  to  find  housing.  Investing  in  a  single  risky
          asset is a bad investment strategy. The lower your wealth,
          the more you are likely not to have other assets. Inequality
          is  inevitable.  She  mentions  that  housing  has  not  been  a
          good investment for Black families, which experience racism
          and depressed home prices. The author&#8217;s solution is: &#8221;Policy
          makers  should  completely  abandon  trying  to  preserve  or
          improve  property  values  and  instead  make  their  focus  a
          housing  market  abundant  with  cheap  and  diverse  housing
          types  able  to  satisfy  the  needs  of  people  at  every  income
          level and stage of life.&#8221; I don&#8217;t like the solution. It ignores
          all  the  good  things  about  homeownership.  It  recommends
          government  mistreat  an  investment  good,  and  one  that
          represents <span

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This is a great paper which covers traffic congestion in cities.
          The show that cities with more commuters have more traffic
          congestion and that the congestion follows a power law. But
                                                                          

                                                                          
          then they look at individual cities and its different!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Some  cities  follow  a  power  law,  but  with  a  different
          exponent. Other cities&#8217; plots of population vs. delay have two
          regimes: a power law where delay rose quickly until a certain
          amount and, then, a flatter portion following another power
          law. The authors believe a capacity or behaviorial limit was
          hit. E.g., in Birmingham, the distance driven per driver was
          increasing until 1998, at which it started to decrease and the
          delay-per-driver flattened.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The delay is on a log scale, so fast growing cities really
          hit a wall in congestion. So, Cincinnati started on the steep
          portion of the plot with 10 hours of delay per year. A decade
          later, it hit 25 or 30 hours of delay per year and then started
          to flat-line. Three decades later, the delay was still under 40
          hours per year.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I&#8217;m fascinated by the paper&#8217;s Figure 2. It shows that the
          power-law coefficient for all cities dropped from 1980 to 2007,
          and then flattened. So, delay was much worse in large cities in
          1980, but the difference between large and small cities got less
          over time. Figure 3 makes me believe that this is because delay
          got worse in smaller cities, not better in large ones. Maybe
          it is because more small cities grew into larger cities and hit
          their capacity limits?

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This was difficult to read. I had it recommended to me, so
          I read it. But I ended up putting a copy into an editor and
          massaging it until I got its arguments.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   This  blog  post&#8217;s  big  point  is  that  we&#8217;ve  split  the
          housing  market  in  two:  one  for  landlords  and  another
                                                                          

                                                                          
          for  owner-occupied  housing.  The  owner-occupiers  get  tax
          benefits,  mortgage  deduction  benefits,  etc.  and  pay  less
          per-year for their house. That&#8217;s an economic rent. To exclude
          people  from  gaining  it,  there&#8217;s  a  bidding  contest  and  the
          creditworthy and wealthy win it.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  author  packed  a  lot  of  other  points  into  the  blog
          post. One is that a property is a risky asset. In a well-run
          market, that risk should be diversified by combining it with
          other risky assets. Under Market Portfolio Theory, only the
          (entire)  market  risk  has  a  risk-adjusted  excess  profit.  But
          we&#8217;ve structured the housing market so that houses are not
          diversified. Thus, homeownership comes with a risk premium.
          This adds to the benefits of homeownership. (If you&#8217;re wealthy
          enough to survive the risk!)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Politicians say they want everyone to be middle class and
          owning a home is part of that. But benefits of owning a home
          come from the economic rents, so they cannot be available to
          everyone.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author says that the economic rents are reserved for
          the creditworthy. In the lead up to the Financial Crisis, credit
          was extended to a lot more people. This expanded the number
          of owner-occupiers bidding on houses and prices rose. When
          credit was withdrawn, it was left to landlords to bid on houses.
          Given their higher per-year costs, they couldn&#8217;t bid as high for
          the houses. Thus, the crash. (This paragraph has been what
          I believe the author meant; it wasn&#8217;t perfectly clear.)

          <p class="bibitem-p" >The paper claims that zoning took off in the 1910&#8217;s because
          of  large  gas-powered  vehicles.  The  bus  and  truck  allowed
          apartments and industry to operate on land in the suburbs.
          Previously,  hauling  goods  was  expensive  and  most  people
          moved by train (street car).
                                                                          

                                                                          
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   With the large vehicle&#8217;s ability to go on any road, it was
          necessary by law to protect the neighborhoods. Developers
          used convenants for a time, but didn&#8217;t protect the edge of the
          neighborhood. Then they pushed for legislation.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author says that other excuses for zoning were present
          at other times. But zoning took off all over the USA in the
          1910s. It was enacted to preserve home prices in an era of
          technological change.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  author  blames  zoning  for  the  fragmentation  of
          American metropolitan areas into many cities. Previously, if
          there were two separate cities, the urban downtown of the
          larger could expand into the smaller one. The smaller town
          would merge with the larger, to get its services as business
          developed. But, with the new legal power, smaller cities could
          remain  suburbs  and  stop  incursions  from  commercial  and
          industrial users.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Regional government entities were proposed, but killed.
          Local control stayed.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   A great quote: &#8221;That the detached, owner-occupied home
          is at the top of the zoning pyramid is evident in nearly all
          zoning laws. ... The primacy of homeownership remains so
          widespread that we hardly think of it as something requiring
          explanation.  Yet  there  is  no  theoretical  reason  why  other
          uses of land should be regarded as less important. Apartment
          dwellers are as much citizens as home dwellers; owning has
          long commanded no special municipal privilege.&#8221; (pg. 17)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He   says   that   homeowners   invest   in   a   single   large
          un-diversifiable asset and form political entities to protect its
          value.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author says that people only started to notice zoning&#8217;s
          affect on housing prices around 1970. He&#8217;s not sure why it
          showed up then. One theory is that &#8221;industrial parks&#8221; showed
          up and suburbs got some jobs. This drew poor and Blacks
          (freed by civil rights lawsuits) to move nearby. Suburbs forced
          high land prices to keep them out. The author believes that
          exclusion is far more income-based than racial.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   To validate the new exclusion, suburbs used environmental
          and &#8221;growth management&#8221; language. The rules advocated for
                                                                          

                                                                          
          larger lots and open space zoning. (Open space zoning used
          large lots and banned development in large areas under the
          term &#8221;conservation&#8221;.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Also in the 1970s era, Regional government entities were
          set up. This was called &#8221;The Quiet Revolution&#8221; by Bosselman
          and Callies (1971). The regional entities used &#8221;double veto&#8221;:
          things could be vetoed at either the local or regional level.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   As for solutions, the author suggests taxing the imputed
          rent  of  owner-occupied  houses.  This  would  lower  home
          ownership.   Switzerland   does   this   and   has   30%   home
          ownership. He admits that this is an &#8221;unlikely policy&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The other solution is home equity insurance. The author
          cites many sources for a few programs on page 30. He wants
          to  insure  the  price  of  a  <span 
class="cmti-12">neighborhood</span>,  not  the  whole  city.
          He realizes there is moral hazard. And it would be hard to
          calculate. And hard to get off the ground.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   My   opinion   is   that   the   author   does   a   great   job
          of  demonstrating  that  the  invention  of  buses  and  truck
          contributed, and may have been the primary cause, of zoning
          being adopted nation-wide. It seems like that zoning was to
          preserve home values. But it changed later, as a means to fight
          growth. I don&#8217;t think the author finds the meat there. I don&#8217;t
          think taxing the imputed rent is politically viable, at any level
          of government. I like the idea of insuring home values, but
          insurance is a one-sided option with a lot of down-side for
          the seller. I don&#8217;t think you could find investors with enough
          capital to insure every house in America&#8217;s cities.</p></div>

          into  a  single  risky  asset  and  they  fear  its  crash.  When
          evaluating any change to a neighborhood, they look at the
          potential downside.

          apartment owners or apartment dwellers. Occasionally, you
          find business owners, but they are usually trying to prevent
          competition.  He  believe  apartment  owners  face  the  same
          effects as homeowners, but are more diversified.

          value.  Prices  include  costs  such  as  property  taxes,  health
          hazards,  congestion,  school  quality,  crime  rates,  and  air
          pollution. They also price-in events in the future, like potential
          industrial construction nearby.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He discusses house-price insurance, but says it is hard to
          write the contract that a homeowner wants and an insurer will
          accept. It is hard to price the effects on a particular house or
          neighborhood. If a homeowner signs, they might not maintain
          the house, in order to get a larger payout. Also, there is a risk
          of an insurer going bankrupt, since the one-sided risk is so
          large.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He mentions that house-price insurance is not a panacea.
          If homeowners are insured against losses, they don&#8217;t do what&#8217;s
          best for the neighborhood! We need <span

          doesn&#8217;t advocate becoming a renter-majority society.

          homeowner insurance contracts as a solution to the NIMBY
          problem&#8221;. He says other solutions are possible. One is Caplin
          et al. 1991, where homeowners enter partnerships. Another
          is Case-Shiller home-value insurance using a city-wide index.
          Any  diversification  helps.  &#8221;It  may  be  that  the  NIMBY
          problem will fade as a result of more efficient financial markets

          size cost&#8221; is the median rent for a unit of the size divided by
          the median rent of households of that size. The &#8221;demographic

          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   A  very  good  paper.  My  hypothesis  is  that  families  at

          on housing and transportation. Thus, a higher rent burden
          is where transportation is cheap. That is, public transit is
          common. That the &#8221;rent gap&#8221; is largest in the densest parts
          of the state, seems to support that idea.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >A very readable book that argues that zoning is unnecessary.
          It describes what zoning does (restricts use, restricts size) and
          what it does not do (mandate construction, protect health and
          safety, protect the environment, plan for the future). Zoning
          doesn&#8217;t even &#8221;solve&#8221; the problem of externalities like noise,
          smell, shade, etc..
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   In NYC, zoning was instituted to restrict building size. The
          Equitable Building was so large that the price of office space
          plummeted.  Zoning  limited  building  volume  so  that  didn&#8217;t
          happen again.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Berkeley  implmented  an  early  zoning  plan  for  other
          reasons.   &#8221;Residential   areas&#8221;   kept   apartments   of   poor
          (including  &#8221;negroes  and  Orientals&#8221;)  out  of  the  suburbs.
          Banning businesses kept Chinese-laundry (and the Chinese)
          out of the suburbs. Berkeley&#8217;s zoning was non-heirarchical &#8212;
          it kept residential out of industrial areas. This was used by
          business interests to force housing out of downtown areas and
          attract more businesses (with jobs and tax revenue).
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Zoning drives up prices. Single-room occupancies (SROs)
          are banned. Parking required. Heights limited. Empty land
          mandated. The approval process delays housing. Etc. It makes
          cities worse and America poorer.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Zoning was enabled by and enabled segregation. By race
          and class.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Fixing  the  problems  requires  loosening  zoning,  but  the
          author  considers  abolishing  it  all  together.  Zoning  doesn&#8217;t
          accomplish its goals. It doesn&#8217;t address most externalities and,
          those it does, it does roughly. It isn&#8217;t the best mechanism for
          planning growth.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Houston is the example of a city without zoning. Most
          of  its  residents&#8217;  desire  for  zoning  is  fulfilled  by  deed
          restrictions, which are enforced by the city government. Some
          of  zoning&#8217;s  aspects  show  up  elsewhere  (don&#8217;t  build  in  a
          floodplain, optional parking minimums, some business banned
          everywhere in the city). Houston is still segregated by use,
          but that is driven by the market. I wish the author had gone
                                                                          

                                                                          
          into  more  detail  on  this  important  aspect  of  the  solution:
          &#8221;As  Siegan  observes,  it&#8217;s  not  uncommon  for  homeowners&#8217;
          associations to simply pay off owners of abutting properties
          to  avoid  more  offensive  uses,  such  as  gas  stations  or  car
          dealerships&#8221;. (Page 155)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author says that if zoning is abolished, planning needs
          to change. Laws need to focus on externalities directly, like
          noise and smell. Planner&#8217;s duties can be replaced by mediators.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  author  says  that  planning  needs  to  fight  the
          segregation that it helped create. Not just remove zoning, but
          use the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and
          Section 8 vouchers to put poorer families in high-opportunity
          areas.  The  author  believe  inclusionary  zoning  is  bad.  He
          supports community land trusts (CLT). (I find CLTs very very
          expensive for their benefit.)</p></div>

          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The first sentence is &#8221;This book is an attack on current
          city planning and rebuilding.&#8221; The victims of the attack are
          architects and planners who think that the best cities have
          tall buildings in park-like environments. (These go by brand
          names &#8221;City Beautiful&#8221;, &#8221;Garden City&#8221; and &#8221;Radiant City&#8221;.)
          She also attacks governments who subsidize suburbs and who
          essentailly &#8221;clear the slums and rebuild&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Her first chapter is on Safety. She defines a city as a place
          with a lot of strangers and the residents of a city block (people
          living there and business owners) need to defend themselves
          from strangers. There are 2 ways to do this. One way is to
          demark &#8221;Turfs&#8221; which are patrolled by gangs (in poor areas)
          or private security guards (in rich ones). The alternative is
          an  organic  defense:  the  dangerous  person  is  detected,  the
          alarm communicated to fellow residents, and enough residents
          mass  in  the  street  to  fend  off  the  danger.  This  organic
          defense only comes through visibility of danger, stability of
          residents, communication, building of trust through voluntary
          interactions, and fast response.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The organic defense is encouraged by fostering interaction
          of residents on sidewalks using mixed-use, short blocks, high
          traffic at all hours, recreation in public rather than private,
          etc. You also need big windows looking over street, no blind
          spots, etc.. Parks are bad &#8212; plenty of blind spots, far from
          windows,  usually  low-traffic.  It&#8217;s  where  gangs  fight,  where
          boys  sneak  off  to  do  bad  things,  and  where  the  homeless
          gather. A few parks, which are small and have traffic at all
          hours with various crowds at different times, are successes.
          Activity-based amenties, like swimming pools (and libraries?),
          can  be  good.  In  addition  to  parks,  other  borders  between
          streets, like highways, railroads and rivers, also cut the organic
          fabric.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter   6&#8217;s   title   says   &#8221;neighborhoods&#8221;   but   means
          &#8221;governing&#8221;.  The  author  doesn&#8217;t  see  a  boundary  for  a
          neighborhood &#8212; the city is a continuous piece of overlapping
          relationships: friends, customers of business, schools, etc.. In
          her mind, there is your block and your city and nothing in
          between. She says there is a political role to be played by
                                                                          

                                                                          
          districts of size about 100,000. Basically, no citywide politician
          cares about your block. You need a district size to be where
          someone on your block can gather enough voices from nearby
          blocks to get the attention of an assemblyman at the city level
          and that the assemblyman has enough power to get stuff done
          with the police, the traffic planners, etc.. She comments that
          many cities are not very democratic because of their structure
          and hoops that residents must try to run through.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Quote  from  pg.  181,  &#8221;Here  is  a  seeming  paradox:  To
          maintain in a neighborhood sufficient people who stay put, a
          city must have the very fluidity and mobility of use ...&#8221;
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I have not read Chapters 7 through 15 yet.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 15 is about money. There is real damage done
          to  neighborhoods  that  could  not  get  loans  because  banks
          blacklisted them after planners designated them as &#8221;slums&#8221; or
          bad. Existing buildings are not improved; bad buildings are
          not torn down and replaced. Her early example of Boston&#8217;s
          North End is brought up. It was only sustained and improved
          by  people  paying  cash  and  by  construction  people  living
          there. When money does flood into a slum, it often displaces
          residents and destroys the social fabric.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Tax law also drove people to be slumlords. Owners did
          not invest so that profits came as capital gains rather than
          income.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The author mentions that eminant domain hurts because
          it  pays  only  for  the  land/building  and  not  everything  the
          owner had invested betting on a stable future. Some cities
          have &#8221;quick-take&#8221; laws that grab the land immediately and
          settle the price later, so that profiteers cannot buy property
          that will be later eminantly domained.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 16 is about subsidized housing. The author has
          sharp comments about lack of housing is about lack of money.
          She  recommends  subsidizing  rent  and  guaranteed  loans  to
          building owners who provide it. She would let owners choose
          their residents.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I did not read Chapters 17 through the end.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I didn&#8217;t have time to read all of this book but I want to! It is
          an engaging and eye-opening. The author has new ideas with
                                                                          

                                                                          
          lots of examples. The author never uses the words &#8221;organic
          fabric&#8221;, but that&#8217;s what she means. It&#8217;s a difficult concept
          for  planning  &#8212;  improving  may  require  a  local  &#8221;gardener&#8221;
          rather than a distance mathematical bureaucrat. Even the
          first question that I&#8217;d want to ask, &#8221;how do you measure it?&#8221;,
          is a quandry. Page 174-179 talks about the social network
          in a neighborhood and mentions the number of connections
          between any two people. It&#8217;s a kind of &#8221;six-degrees&#8221; but within
          the neighborhood. Perhaps that&#8217;s a way to measure it. But the
          next question, &#8221;what do planners do to make a neighborhood
          better connected?&#8221; gets even more complex. Even if there&#8217;s
          complexity, the author has redirected everyone&#8217;s gaze at it.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This is a big-thought book about the economic development
          of humanity, like &#8221;Guns, Germs, and Steel&#8221;, by Jane Jacobs.
          She wrote &#8221;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&#8221;
          which is a classic book that upset the world of urban planning.
          This book is facinating, dense with ideas backed by anecdotes
          from cities. It tries to show that cities are vital to economics
          and a particular process in cities drives economic growth. My
          major problem with it is that it doesn&#8217;t use math. While this
          book is fertile for ideas, its main argument should have use
          the precision and rigor of mathematics to prove its point.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Her  big  idea  is  that  economic  growth  is  driven  by
          &#8221;import  substitution&#8221;  in  cities.  In  her  model  of  a  city,
          it  has  exports,  imports,  export-producing  industry,  and
          (self-)consumption-producing industry. The exports pay for
          the city&#8217;s imports. Growth happens rapidly when a city starts
          producing  goods  that  it  used  to  import.  E.g.,  Tokyo  used
          to import bicycles, but now makes them locally. This new
          industry  increases  the  local  economy  but  also  has  another
                                                                          

                                                                          
          effect. The city&#8217;s exports pay for the imports and now the city
          can buy even more of other imports. These can help the city
          produce more goods that it used to import, causing growth
          and the cycle to happen again. It is that cyclic feedback that
          Jacobs believes drives rapid growth in cities (and economies).
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  book  is  about  more  than  that  idea.  She  believes
          economics  is  about  cities.  (She  points  out  that  industry
          is  not  evenly  spread  across  the  land,  but  concentrated  in
          cities.) That cities pre-date agriculture. (She speculates about
          a city in Turkey trading obsidian before argiculture.) That
          the conventional story if &#8221;argiculture blooms and then cities
          develop&#8221;  is  wrong.  She  says  cities  produce  tools  that  help
          farmers be more productive.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   She  has  an  organic  view  of  cities.  She  says  cities  that
          focus on mass production in a single industry do not grow
          and develop. She thinks the best cities have an mix of small
          companies which grow and innovate. The book contains many
          stories  about  new  products  being  developed,  such  as  3M
          changing  from  being  a  mining  company  to  making  a  wide
          varies adhesives. She mentioned how Japan learned to make
          bicycles slowly: first repairing bikes, then making their own
          parts to repair bikes, and then, eventually, making the whole
          bike. She tells the story of a factory being set up in a small
          town and it failing, but it succeeded quickly when relocated
          into  a  city.  She  tells  many  stories  of  employees  &#8221;breaking
          away&#8221; to start a new business. She has a great metaphor about
          organic  development  on  pg.  129:  biologists  once  thought  a
          fertilized egg was a tiny baby, only needing to grow larger. We
          now know the egg is a single cell and the fetus develops by
          cells splitting and specializing.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   She has a great set of examples about how geography is
          not destiny. There were other settlements near New York and
          London with better harbors. Those settlements should have
          had the advantage in growth. But they didn&#8217;t. Something else
          drove growth and development.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I  will  say  that  two  of  her  strongest  stories  did  not
          move  me.  They  were  about  the  growth  in  Japan  and  Los
          Angeles after WWII. Both were far away from where they
                                                                          

                                                                          
          imported goods from (USA, East Coast). So, the standard
          economic motivations to move production locally make sense
          &#8212; transportation costs were high (at that time). It would be
          interesting to compare where expensive transportation drives
          local growth and where it does not. In the 1600 to 1900&#8217;s,
          colonies  were  far  away  but  only  some  grew.  Jacob&#8217;s  view
          is that colonies were either focused on single-product mass
          production  or  the  colonizers  prevented  locals  from  making
          imports locally.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   She has distain for Adam Smith&#8217;s view that specialization
          leads to more production. Smith&#8217;s classic example is the 10
          specialists doing different jobs will make 4,800 pins per day per
          person, and 1 generalist struggles to make a handful. Jacobs
          says  &#8221;Division  of  labor  is  a  device  for  achieving  operating
          efficiency, nothing more.&#8221; (pg. 82). She considers the idea of
          creating the pin in the first place to be the important part.
          Innovation eventually lead to a pin-making machine that put
          all the specialists out of business! She does value the division
          of labor because a 10-step process has 10 (or even 45) places
          where innovation can occur, if allowed.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   For a book from 1969, it feels very predictive of the last
          50 years. She mentions recycling. Investing in startups. That
          services will differentiate and grow faster than manufacturing.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   This is an amazing book because it has lots of stories and
          will get you thinking in new directions. I don&#8217;t accept its story
          of &#8221;import substitution&#8221;, because it is too reductionist. It may
          explain a city&#8217;s growth but not the economy&#8217;s. Doesn&#8217;t import
          substituion  mean  that  manufacturing  has  moved  from  the
          exporting city to the importing one, not new manufacturing
          has been created? It might grow the economy if local resources
          are used, but then it is those resources that are causing growth,
          not the movement of the manufacturing.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   I do like her view of cities as organic. If we view a city
          as a network of processes, where each takes input goods and
          produces  output  goods,  then  the  network  can  only  change
          by little steps. A process can grow. A process can mutate
          to produce a slightly different product. A process can move
          from outside the city to inside it. A process can split or a
                                                                          

                                                                          
          new process can replicate an existing process. Innovation can
          create a brand new process, but it still has to connect it into
          the network. It helps where there are lots of places to connect
          it to. That may be why cities succeed: not just lots of products
          for customers but lots of places in a network where innovation
          can find a place.</p></div>

          data around the world: man travels a mean of about 1 hour
          per day. They believe its origination is biological, governing
          the territory controlled by primitive man.

          square km. The radius is about 2.5 km and, at a walking speed
          of 5 km/hr, travel is about 1 hour round trip. The author
          claims that cities got larger due to changes in the speed of
          transportation technology, with similar-timed commutes.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Car travel averages about .9 hours per day, at most income
          levels. Very low income people travel about .7 hours per day.
          The  miles  driven  per  year  in  the  USA  is  stable  at  9,400.
          (NOTE: This seems too stable and the value now is 13,400,
          so it is not stable.) Travel consumption is stable around 13%.
          Death rates per year is also freekishly stable around 22,000
          per year. (NOTE: This doesn&#8217;t match data on Wikipedia. The
          number there has much more variability, but is stable around
          35,000 per year.)

          travel,  with  technology.  The  number  of  messages  or  calls
          has  increased  exponentially,  as  have  trips.  The  number  of
          messages/calls follows a graviational law, proportional to the
          populations of two cities divided by the distance apart.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   City population in 1920 followed a Zipf distribution, linear
          in log(population) and log(rank by size). The author claims
          that, if you use the 30 minute commute and include planes
          and high-speed trains, it still holds because of areas like the
          Boston-to-DC  corridor.  The  final  graph  shows  mobility  in
          France. Technology changes mean speed increases about 3%
          per year.</p></div>

          <p class="bibitem-p" >The author builds economic models to explain homelessness.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The basic model has 3 levels of housing: homeless, low
          quality,  and  high  quality.  Agents  have  an  income  and  a
          standard utility model, increasing in money and home quality.
          The  model  demonstrates  that  poor  people,  in  the  right
          situtations, will choose homelessness.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  author  extends  this  to  a  model  with  a  continuum
          of quality ranges, from 0 to positive infinity. And then adds
          construction of homes, maintenance, filtering, etc.. Models are
          similar to filtering models of Sweeney 1974 and Arnott 1987.

          <p class="bibitem-p" >The book starts pretty boring. Chapter 2 is a discussion of the
          various definitions of &#8221;homeless&#8221;. For example, are people in
          a shelter &#8221;homeless&#8221;? Chapter 3 is an undramatic discussion
          of why homelessness is bad for other people. Strangely, for an
          economist, it doesn&#8217;t try to put it in financial terms. Chapter
          4 is a history of homelessness and data for it. Which is pretty
          awful, up to 1996.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 5 is interesting: it compares the homeless, who
          sleep  outdoors  or  in  shelters,  to  what  most  people  call
          &#8221;homeless&#8221;,  the  people  that  beg,  collect  cans,  and  wash
          windshields.  He  refers  to  those  as  &#8221;colloquially  homeless&#8221;
          or &#8221;daytime streetpeople&#8221; or simply &#8221;streetpeople&#8221;. There is
          overlap. The author&#8217;s study in New York said about 3/4 of
          streetpeople are homeless, but 1/4 live with someone or have
          their own place. Most have slept in a shelter but do not like
          them. The streetpeople earn a variable income that is below
          minimum  wage.  Those  that  reported  hours  worked  around
          7 hours a day. 2/3 work 7 days a week; the rest are evenly
          split between 1 and 6 days a week. 3/4 say they would take
          a low-wage job. About 1/2 get public assistance, which might
          go away with a job. If given extra money, about 1/3 said they
          would spend it on alcohol or drugs. 2/3 said they didn&#8217;t have
          a way to save money!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 6 describes an economic model of housing and
          homelessness,  without  any  equations.  But  it  uses  phrases
          like  &#8221;price-quality  schedule&#8221;,  so  good  luck  understanding
          the  chapter  without  an  advanced  econ  degree.  I  have
          one  and,  for  me,  it  might  have  been  easier  with  some
          equations. The model has a high-end market, where houses
          are  built  and  maintained,  a  low-end  market,  where  houses
          are not maintained and deteriorate in quality, and, finally,
          homelessness.  The  interesting  part  is  the  low-end  market,
          where changes in costs ripple down determine who is homeless.
                                                                          

                                                                          
          It is a model of a market at equilbrium and the author walks
          through various scenarios that will change the equilibrium.
          They&#8217;re summarized in Table 6-1 at the end of the chapter.
          It is a well-constructed model but I&#8217;m not sure how well it
          represents reality. Buildings take decades to age, so are cities
          actually near equilibrium? Also, the
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 7 looks at the effect of income inequality. The
          author uses an unusual metric: the slope of a line fitted to
          the lower-half of an income histogram. Yeah. Very unusual.
          He  leaves  out  a  lot  of  details.  He  claims  that  it  explains
          homelessness  very  well,  &#8221;allowing  for  lags&#8221;  (pg.  132).  But
          what is an appropriate amount of &#8221;lag&#8221;? Increases in the price
          of low-rent housing predicts homelessness. On page 142 he
          starts a history of very low-rent housing. Every place has a
          different name and regulation for them: flop houses, SROs,
          cubicle hotels, etc. Many closed due to profitability in the
          early 80&#8217;s. Some had high vacancies. It&#8217;s not clear why that
          explains anything. He uses fire reports and demolition records
          but I don&#8217;t find the data and/or story compelling.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 8 looks at financial influences on housing. Interest
          rates  and  inflation  are  too  small  to  affect  operating  costs
          in his model. The opportunity cost of land (which he calls
          &#8221;gentrification&#8221;). This didn&#8217;t explain homelessness in the 80&#8217;s,
          but it might now in Austin and San Francisco.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 9 examines other studies that compare multiple
          cities  against  each  other.  It  includes  Tucker  1987,  Tucker
          1987b, Quigley 1990, Elliot and Krivo 1991, Burt 1992, and
          Honig  and  Filer  1993.  He  doesn&#8217;t  like  their  data!  There
          are  different  definition  of  metro-area:  Census  Bureau  and
          Rand-McNally.  Pg.  167  has  some  insights:  &#8221;wealthier  cites
          should provide more shelter, since charity is a normal good,
          and  so  should  cities  with  more  valuable  real  estate,  since
          removing homeless people from such real estate yields a higher
          return&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter  10  covers  government.  &#8221;New  York  has  not
          prevented the construction of shanties, but has confined their
          construction to the most primitive technology.&#8221; And, now,
          Austin  has  confined  people  to  tents.  He  mentioned  that
                                                                          

                                                                          
          health regulations may include window size, ventilation, and
          minimum floor area to limit the spread of TB. He says that
          regulations may be needed to keep buildings maintained: the
          owner going bankrupt will not profit from maintenance (the
          bank  will)  and  may  not  maintain  the  building.  He  notes
          a distinction between &#8221;grandfathered&#8221; regulation, where the
          existing uncompliant are legalized, and &#8221;retrofit&#8221; regulations,
          which requires owners to invest to meet the standard. Owners
          of grandfathered buildings have &#8221;something valuable &#8212; an
          exemption  from  regulation&#8221;.  NYC  banned  SROs,  but  the
          author doesn&#8217;t think it affected homelessness. One argument
          is high vacancy rates. One cost is parking spaces, even if the
          law  only  requires  1  for  every  6  rooms.  Low-cost  landlords
          suffer  from  caparicious  enforcement  of  rules.  Rent  control
          means owners do not invest in maintenance and that owners
          discriminate on residents (rather than price), which may mean
          the unhoused are &#8221;lemons&#8221; that the landlords don&#8217;t want.
          Making  evictions  harder  hurts  low-cost  landlords,  because
          more  tenants  are  disruptive  and  fewer  can  pay  (or  have
          seizable assets) to make up for the eviction costs. &#8221;A former
          SRO owner in Newark, for instances, gave as his main reason
          for  leaving  the  business  the  hassle  and  liability  that  had
          become part of it; he thought that the only perons who would
          buy a cheap hotel now was the &#8217;thickest-skinned SOB in the
          world&#8217;.&#8221;. O&#8217;Flaherty thinks tenants rights contributed high
          vacancy and, a small amount, to homelessness. He believes
          &#8221;public housing for the middle class increases homelessness;
          ... for the very poor, reduces it.&#8221;. 1/3 of homeless women in
          a shelter said they would&#8217;t live in Chicago public housing due
          to the lack of safety.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He  says  Section  8  has  a  certificate,  which  pays  the
          difference  between  actual  rent  and  30%  of  income,  and  a
          voucher, which pays the difference between &#8221;fair market rent&#8221;
          and  30%  of  income.  Those  with  voucher  still  need  their
          residence  checked  by  the  housing  authority!  Why?!  Food
          stamp  funds  increase  with  rent,  so  it&#8217;s  a  rental  assistance
          program! WTF?!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Rental vacancy was studied by Rosen and Smith 1983 and
                                                                          

                                                                          
          Arnott 1989. Vacancy is complicated. Pairing a landlord with
          a  tenant  is  a  two-sided  process.  Landlords  decide  the  rent
          and also how much to advertise and any renter requirements.
          Tenants decide their price limits, where to search, how much to
          search, and how much effort to meet landlords&#8217; requirements.
          Vacancy around 7% or 9% is &#8221;natural&#8221;. O&#8217;Flaherty doesn&#8217;t
          think vacancy explain homelessness.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 11 is about welfare (&#8221;income maintenance&#8221;) in
          wealthy countries. New York&#8217;s General Assistance encouraged
          living  on  the  street:  Unsheltered  receive  <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>305;  those  in  a
          shelter get <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>149. Bureaucracy in the USA makes it hard to sign
          up <span 
class="cmti-12">and </span>hard to stay on the list. &#8221;one chance in eight of opening
          a  case  and  maintaining  it  for  a  year.&#8221;  System  is  complex
          and  time-consuming.  Making  and  keeping  appointments  is
          difficult for homeless. Many homeless seek independence and
          avoid hassle. Mental health and disability determinations are
          hard and bureaucratic. (They&#8217;re medical decisions in Canada.)
          Programs  incentivize  black-market  work,  like  begging  and
          cleaning windshields, because official job income reduces their
          income from SSI or other programs. The &#8221;tax&#8221; is 100% for
          New York&#8217;s general assistance.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Under  sharing  housing,  the  author  says  social  security
          (SSI) and foot stamps have &#8221;strong disincentives for sharing
          housing&#8221;. SSI reduces by 1/3. Foodstamps give more for 2
          people living apart than living together. This programs were
          growing rapidly in the 1970s, before homelessness took off in
          the 1980s!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 12 is about mental health. The chapter looks at
          the release of people from mental hospitals in the 1960s and
          says that was unlikely to be a cause of homelessness later.
          Some women make themselves dirty and act crazy to scare off
          attackers. For low-cost housing where people shared rooms,
          a few people with mental health problems has a large effect.
          Also, repair costs and liability go up. Many have &#8221;innkeeper
          liability&#8221;, which means the law blames them for bad guests
          causing problems to other guests! There may be a tipping
          point, where enough mentally ill poison all low-cost housing,
          but the author finds little evidence for it.
                                                                          

                                                                          
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 13 is about drugs. Taking drugs is a choice and
          the author sweetly says, &#8221;Volition means economics.&#8221; He says
          crack became popular because it is cheap. (Powdered cocaine
          was  sold  by  gram;  crack  by  1/20th  of  a  gram.)  Different
          drugs are substitutes and crack displaced powdered cocaine
          and amphetamines. Maybe alcohol too. But crack is not a
          substitute for housing! Cheaper highs mean that more money
          is left for housing. Housing demand should have increased!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   But that analysis skips a lot, such as the lost productive
          hours of someone who gets high and the instability of highs
          and  lows  (which  causes  people  to  lose  jobs).  And  maybe
          other changes? Drugs and alcohol are common amoung shelter
          residents. Half took cocaine in one study. Cocaine use did spike
          in the 1980s. Cirrhosis deaths spiked in the 1970s ... why? The
          timing of homelessness doesn&#8217;t really line up with emergency
          room visits. The author concludes that &#8221;at least as good an
          argument can be made that crack reduced homelessness as
          that it increased homelessness.&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter  14  is  about  cops  and  prisons.  Many  homeless
          have been in jail (31%) or prison (18%). Homelessness doesn&#8217;t
          cause people to go to prison, but releases of prisoners increases
          homelessness.  They  have  a  hard  time  getting  work,  may
          have a harder time finding a place to rent, and have fewer
          social connections to help. Prisoner releases didn&#8217;t cause the
          problems in the 1980&#8217;s, but maybe contribute today? Common
          laws used against homeless are: loitering (unconstitutional),
          vagrancy (unconstitutional), obstructing sidewalks, begging,
          public drinking or drunkenness, and commitment to mental
          institutions. Police are usually sympathetic to the homeless:
          they have to deal with them regularly, there&#8217;s little benefit
          in conflict, and the police like support from other institutions
          who might react negatively if they abuse the homeless. Police
          just  displace  the  homeless,  not  fix  things.  Homeless  might
          prefer jail, with warmth and food. We don&#8217;t have much data
          on Black homelessness during the 1950&#8217;s and 1960&#8217;s, but it
          increased in 1970&#8217;s. Why? The author mentions less racism,
          but doesn&#8217;t mention migration, which happened then.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Chapter 15 is the author&#8217;s diagnosis and prescription. He
                                                                          

                                                                          
          thinks  homelessness  in  NYC  in  the  1980&#8217;s  was  caused  by
          the  &#8221;middle  class  shrinking&#8221;  (income  distribution  changes)
          in the 1970&#8217;s. His model predicts that less low-cost housing
          was provided. Also contributing were zoning regulations, strict
          housing-maintenance  laws,  difficulty  evicting  tenants,  more
          ex-prisoners, and more generous shelters. Low priced crack
          may have helped end homelessness. Newark&#8217;s story is similar.
          Chicago didn&#8217;t see a shift in the income distribution and didn&#8217;t
          see homelessness. He waves his hands with Toronto. He dodges
          with London and Hamburg. In fact, he goes so far as to say
          &#8221;perhaps maintenance is cheap relative to construction so that
          the models of Chapter 6 don&#8217;t apply.&#8221;!!! This is my biggest
          problem with his model: how does he know it works at all?
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   His  policy  recommendations  are:  Do  not  discriminate
          against  or  in  favor  of  the  homeless.  E.g.,  different  welfare
          payments,  access  to  services,  etc..  The  police  should  focus
          on crime, not anti-social behavior. This includes prosecuting
          crimes against the homeless and crimes by the homeless. He
          says police should do &#8221;aggressive but nonpunitive referral&#8221;
          but I&#8217;m not sure what that means. Right after, he talks about
          the Port Authority bus terminal and Grand Central terminal
          being  clear  of  homeless.  He  says  that  the  homeless  should
          <span 
class="cmti-12">not </span>be allowed to build shanties, because they&#8217;re unsafe and
          violate the law.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Cities should not run shelters; they should hand out an
          allowance and let private companies run shelters. Shelters will
          then compete to be the preferred place and improve services
          to the homeless. (Cities may run shelters for natural disasters,
          etc.) Private shelters should be allowed to offer better rooms
          for cash on top of the allowance, creating a working market
          for low-cost housing. (NOTE: In Austin, there is probably a
          huge discontinuity between a free bed in a shelter and <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>700 for
          an apartment!) The author prefers entitlements, because they
          provide predictability for everyone. For disruptive homeless
          people, which private shelters will not house for the allowance,
          he  recommends  selectively  increasing  the  allowance.  &#8221;This
          scheme won&#8217;t work perfectly ... but I can think of no scheme
          that  would  work  better.&#8221;  (NOTE:  Let  charities  deal  with
                                                                          

                                                                          
          them?) Later, on page 289, he says &#8221;A commitment to zero
          homelessness is unworkable&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He describes public housing rules as giving &#8221;authorities a
          choice between running empty buildings and running buildings
          full of fairly well-off people&#8221;. A study says that for every <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>2
          spent on public housing, residents would pay only <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>1 for it.
          His non-discrimination policy says that homeless should <span 
class="cmti-12">not</span>
          move to the front of the queue for public housing. He also says
          that there shouldn&#8217;t be a waiting list for public housing &#8212; it
          should be a random draw of all applicants! (Waiting longer
          doesn&#8217;t mean &#8221;more deserving&#8221;.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   As   for   regulations,   he   doesn&#8217;t   like   &#8221;apex   zoning&#8221;
          (&#8221;hierarchical zoning&#8221;, I believe). It should be easy to evict
          for any reason (not just &#8221;good cause&#8221;). He points out that
          eviction takes time and money and, for poor residents, putting
          a lein on their possessions won&#8217;t pay for it. (NOTE: Does
          this mean that it would be a good policy to pay landlords for
          evictions, as a form of insurance?) He says we should remove
          &#8221;innkeeper liability&#8221; for lodginghouses and SROs; they should
          have the same liability as apartments. (NOTE: I&#8217;m not sure I
          agree with this; I think allowing eviction for any reason would
          help fix this.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He says working homeless are good, because busy people
          cause fewer problems than welfare clients. He suggests finding
          productive work, paid in cash, in small amounts quickly. He
          suggest  paying  for  each  small  piece  of  work.  He  suggests
          getting rid of the disincentives in assistance plans. He suggests
          hiring should be informal and without any eligibility criteria.
          His example of a good program is &#8221;Street News&#8221; newspaper in
          Chicago and recycling cans in NYC. He suggests discouraging
          begging by allowing charities, like Salvation Army, to solicit
          on the streets!
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He suggests getting rid of the disincentives for doubling
          up  in  SSI  and  foodstamps.  He  suggests  reducing  effective
          marginal tax rates. For drug abusers, he says we should make
          it easier for them to get money like SSI. He suggests disability
          should be more than yes-no proposition, but have degrees.
          Lastly, US programs need to be as friendly and accessible as

          <p class="bibitem-p" >This paper covers research into homelessness by economists
          and practioners.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   It has an interesting discussion of the strengths of studies
          that  focus  on  individual  vs.  averages.  Practioners  want
          individual studies, since it informs how they act. But they
          don&#8217;t provide information on solving homelessness.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   It   has   some   interesting   insights   on   the   &#8221;general
          equilibrium&#8221;, by which the author means how everyone in the
          housing market reacts to a policy. A shelter is more pleasant
          than sleeping rough, so more shelters means that fewer will
          sleep rough and, also, that some people will stay longer. So,
          Housing First treats the homeless, but there aren&#8217;t studies on
          what it does to the system.

          Mentions that rent is factor. Some non-housing interventions
          help, but they&#8217;re relatively expensive.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Journeys  Home  is  a  longitudinal  study  that  covers
          Australians beyond homelessness. It produced a lot of good
          data.  For  men,  trauma  was  seen  on  entering  and  exiting
          homelessness.  Women  experienced  trauma  while  homeless.
          Violence  might  cause  male  homelessness,  but  not  female.
          Addiction,  in  general,  was  not  a  cause  of  homelessness.
          Although heavy alcohol use (a binge) might be causal.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   An  increase  in  EITC  payments  lead  to  fewer  families
          doubling up. But it didn&#8217;t decrease homelessness. The author
                                                                          

                                                                          
          asks &#8221;Why might this be?&#8221; and guesses either it has to do
          with averages or the near-homeless didn&#8217;t apply for EITC.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Evictions   often   preceed   homelessness.   Giving   legal
          representation during evictions help prevent them. But no one
          has studied if landlords change in response.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   He  casts  a  lot  of  doubt  on  HUD&#8217;s  Annual  Homeless
          Assessment Report. This includes the Point-in-Time Count
          (&#8221;homeless census&#8221;, &#8221;PIT Count&#8221;).
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   His own paper (2003) looked at shelter quality and the
          quality  of  living  outside  (rain,  worse  spots  to  camp)  and
          computed an equilibrium for how many homeless would choose
          each. It says how the number of beds affects numbers too &#8212;
          meaning 100 more beds reduces the PIT Count by much fewer
          than 100! Permanent supportive housing is very high quality
          housing and has a predictable effect.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   When  prisoners  are  released,  shelter  numbers  do  not
          increase. But that may be because recently released criminals
          scare people away?
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   If  housing  is  given  to  those  homeless  longest,  it  might
          incentivize people to stay homeless longer to increase their
          odds of &#8221;winning a lottery&#8221;.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Corinth 2017 has formula for predicting homelessness.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   NYC ran a service &#8221;Homebase&#8221; which prioritized treated
          people in their neighborhoods. I&#8217;m not sure all the details, but
          it kept social connections.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Prevention is tricky. Rolston et al. found 14.5% of their
          control  group  entered  shelters  and  8.0%  of  the  treatment
          group. Since only 6.5% were affected, the program could be
          expensive for the effect.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   People have private information on how likely they are to
          be homeless. Still, practioners may find it hard to get honest
          answers  when  the  treatment  depends  on  the  answer.  The
          Homebase program saw evidence with long walks to services.
          The NYC housing program does it by requiring long stays at
          a shelter before getting housing support.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   In NYC, homelessness increased from 2011 to 2017, but the
          housing market was mostly unchanged. Vacancy in low-rent
          apartments fell by 1/3, but it was not significant. Migration
                                                                          

                                                                          
          doesn&#8217;t explain shifts in numbers, even in the NY/NJ area.
          LA saw a similar rise in the city but not surrounding areas.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Under Mayor De Blasio, NYC raised <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>-per-family-day from
          <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>103 to <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>171. (NYC sometimes rents hotel rooms and that&#8217;s
          close to the price of one.)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   On page 62, does a &#8221;thought experiment&#8221; of how many
          Housing Choice Vouchers would be necessary to replace NYC&#8217;s
          shelters and other programs. He believes the money currently
          spent (<span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>1.8 billion) might be able to do it. Pg. 66 says LA&#8217;s
          survey is different from NYC in major ways. E.g., visual not
          interviews. No transit. Non-random. Crappy in every way.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   LA spends far less on homeless services: 1/15th that of
          NYC! That rose to about 1/3 in 2017. &#8221;prevention in Los
          Angeles might also require <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>30,000 to reduce the PIT Count
          by 1&#8221;. Wow. He compares that to rent subsidies, which in
          NYC, cost <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>40,000 to <span 
class="tcrm-1200">$</span>80,000 to reduce the PIT Count by 1.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Economists have not studied the unsheltered homeless. Is
          the difference between cities a matter of enforcement?
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Veterans saw a big decrease in homelessness from 2010 to
          2016. But the age range for high homelessness (18 to 64) also
          fell sharply. There was a large voucher program (HUD-VASH)
          but it may have had little effect.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Homeless families fell by 2/3s between 2010 and 2017. It
          could be because NY state takes kids from homeless families
          and other states copied that. There are other possibilities.
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   Black people are more likely to be homeless, but states
          with  more  Black  residents  tend  to  have  fewer  homeless.
          Drug rates, alcohol abuse, and mental illness are the same
          rate in Blacks as in other groups. The proportion of Black
          incarcerated  is  similar  to  those  homeless.  The  author  says
          another candidate explanation is segregation: a shelter full
          of  Black  people  may  be  offputting  to  White  people.  (But
          wouldn&#8217;t  that  push  up  the  number  of  unsheltered  White
          homeless?)
          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  conclusion  says:  &#8221;We  don&#8217;t  know  how  to  end
          homelessness.&#8221; &#8221;We can&#8217;t explain why homelessness in the
          two biggest American cities exploded in this decade, or why
          it fell in the rest of the country.&#8221; &#8221;On an aggregate level,
                                                                          

                                                                          
          weather, labor market conditions, and housing prices affect
          homelessness, and maybe policies too, but modest changes in
          unemployment or rents cannot be expected to trigger huge
          changes in homelessness.&#8221; &#8221;...; for the most effective policies a
          handful ro two of people have to be treated to reduce aggregate
          homelessness by one.&#8221; &#8221;It&#8217;s a good time for more economists
          to start working on homelessness.&#8221;</p></div>

          </p><p class="bibitem-p" >   The  author  builds  a  simple  stocastic-calculus  model  of
          an individual&#8217;s wealth and, when their wealth falls to zero,
          the individual goes homeless. By &#8221;simple&#8221;, I mean it is still

          &#8221;Pigouvian  homelessness  prevention  program&#8221;.  That  is,
          assuming   homelessness   has   negative   externalities   (like
          smoking  causes  second-hand  lung  cancer),  the  government
          pays a subsidy if you are housed (like subsidizing people not to
          smoke). Usually the Pigouvian response is a tax, like a heavy
          cigarette tax, but taxing the homeless would be cruel. He says
          &#8221;he optimal shelter quality (and street enforcement regime)
          maximizes the instantaneous difference between benefits and
          costs&#8221;.

          &#8221;any  actuarily  fair  insurance  that  reduces  volatility  is
          welfare-improving.&#8221;.</p></div>

          choose between substandard housing or homelessness. (Note
          to self: the oldest housing in Austin is near downtown. Growth
          has caused the least-valuable buildings to be on very valuable
          land. Has this wrecked filtering?)
