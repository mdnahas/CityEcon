  abstract = {We estimate the first cross-sectional index of transaction-based land values for every U.S. metropolitan area. The index accounts for geographic selection and incorporates novel shrinkage methods using a prior belief based on urban economic theory. Land values at the city center increase with city size, as do land-value gradients; both are highly variable across cities. Urban land values are estimated at more than two times GDP in 2006. These estimates are higher and less volatile than estimates from residual (total - structure) methods. Five urban agglomerations account for 48\% of all urban land value in the United States.},

    Estimated the value of land under American cities using 68,756 land transactions.  The paper gets pretty mathy at points and I didn't understand what they were doing.  But, at its core, it is a hedonic regression.  It has choices that I wouldn't make.  They do cross-validate their results.  I wish they reported error bounds on their numbers --- the price-per-acre in the center of the city is exponentially higher than average, so errors are magnified dramatically.  They don't look at the time series, to see if a change in any factor (like center-city prices) indicates a future change (like residential prices).  

\par
    Separated samples by MSA, or primary MSA.   Defined the "city center" to be City Hall or Mayor's office.  (That's a problem in NYC!  I would have chosen the tallest building.)  Some MSAs have multiple city centers (like Minneapolis-St.Paul).  Land is associated with the closest center.  (That's bad when a larger one dominates.)  I don't like that they don't search for the center of the city and don't try to discover more "centers".  

\par
    It uses hedonic regression.  Log(land price) is a linear function based on distance from the city center and other factors.  Distance is the natural log of 1 + the Euclidean distance in miles.   The distance constant varies by city.  The intercept varies by city and year.  The linear function is also adjusted for lot size and proposed used, which can vary by time.  Figure 1 shows a plot from Houston and the linear model seems like a good fit.  When they allow multiple powers of their distance function in the linear regression, there is a higher peak downtown and a flattening of the rest of the graph.  

\par
    They have little data and do some math to create an average city of a given area.  I'm not sure how this works.  They do a similar thing with changes over time.  

\par
    To estimate the value of the whole city, they use their function to predict the price at the centroid of each census tract.  Then they sum all the tracts in the city.

\par
    They find that larger cities have a higher intercept (central land value).  Larger cities have a steeper slope.  There is much variation here, but the trend is for large cities to have downtown values that are 7 times those 10 miles away.  For smaller cities, the value is 1, meaning no change in land value from downtown to 10 miles away.  The average land value for cities is pretty flat.

\par
    As for intended use, "Retail, apartment, mixed use, and medical proposed uses have substantially higher values, while commercial, industrial, and multifamily uses have lower values." I'm not sure how "multifamily" is different from "apartment".  It doesn't list single-family, but the appendix says it is near zero.
    
\par
    The highest central land values are NY, Chicago, D.C., San Francisco, and Los Angeles-Long Beach.  The steepest price slope goes to Chicago and then Washington D.C..  The flattest expensive cities are San Jose and Orange County, CA.  The higher average land values tend to be on the coast.  (Why?)

\par
    Total land value is NYC at \$2.5T, LA at \$2.3T, then SF, D.C., and Chicago.  They account for 48\% of all urban land value.   The total value for the USA in 2010 was \$19.1T.  An alternate way of measuring, "Flow of Funds", put it at \$6.2T.  It only measures private land and covers the whole country; this paper's method covers all of cities, including roads, parks, etc..    
    
\par
    Over time, the land value drops 40\% after the Financial Crisis.  The Case-Shiller index drops 19\%.  Their values don't line up with the stock market's movements at the time.

    Used data from HUD's Section 8 voucher renters.  They matched results of renter surveys with Census data on tract.  (Tracts have 1,200 to 8,000 people.)  Calculated results for 331 metro areas and non-metro areas of 49 states. 

\par
    "one-bedroom apartments rent for about 19 percent more than efficiencies, two-bedroom apartments for 35 percent more than efficiencies, three-bedroom apartments for 53 percent more, and each additional bedroom adds about 10 percent to rent. Living in a census tract where the mean travel time to work is 30 minutes longer reduces rent by about 10 percent. Households with an additional person per bedroom plus one pay about 14 percent more for an identical unit."

\par
    Other price indices (ACCRA's cost of living index, median rent, HUD's Fair Market Rent, and indices derived from PUMS and AHS) all diverge from their price index.

\par
    Distance to city center was done as the average commute of the census tract.  I'm pretty sure I disagree with that in general.

\par
    If the other price indices diverge from this one, how do they know which is "real"?

  abstract = {To explain the large differences in labor productivity across U.S. states, the authors estimate two models--one based on local geographical externalities and the other on the diversity of local intermediate services--where spatial density results in aggregate increasing returns. Both models lead to a relation between county employment density and productivity at the state level. Using data on gross state output, the authors find that a doubling of employment density increases average labor productivity by around 6 percent. More than half of the variance of output per worker across states can be explained by differences in the density of economic activity. Copyright 1996 by American Economic Association.},

    Skimmed this paper.

\par
    It is reportedly a landmark paper (first paper?) in measuring agglomeration effects.  That is, that productivity is increased when we have a lot of people near each other.

\par
    It focuses on counties.   It assumes productivity increases multiplicatively with density.  I skipped a lot of math in its model.  Workers have a preference for low-density locations, which prevents everyone from moving to a single city and being super-productive.  Page 59 and 60 mention land prices, but I'm not sure it is in the model.

\par
    Data was labor input, that excluded the self-employed.  It came from the Regional Economic Measurement Division of the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.  They excluded data from states where mining was more than 15\% of output: Alaska, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
    
\par
    They adjust density with education, state-wide effects, and population of county (without taking into account its area).  Education has a big effect, but the others do not.

\par
    The result is that doubling density is correlated with an increasing labor productivity by 6\%.

\par
    I'd need to read the paper in detail to figure out what this really means.  That is, that the number does capture productivity.  And figure out how land prices work into this.  I don't like that it is on a county basis --- that's such a large scale that it is surprising to see any effect.  My data on land prices in Austin shows that prices change dramatically in a few blocks; Travis County is many many block-widths across.  If density increases exponentially as we get to the center of Austin, the average density of Travis County doesn't measure that peak.  What I'm saying is that we need good find-detail data for measuring cities.

  annote    = {
    The authors felt that the press, public, and even policy makers had a mistaken view of the causes of homelessness.  They wanted to present simple plots of data showing that many commonly discussed "causes" are not the cause.  And that the price of housing was.

\par
    Page 13 and 14 have a great metaphor: musical chairs.  A person with a cast doesn't get a seat, but it isn't because he cannot get to a chair.  It is because there is 1 fewer chairs than people.  Such is homelessness --- we see a lot of individual factors (mental health, addiction, race, etc.) that affect who doesn't gets a home, but we need to look at citywide factors that cause a home shortage.

\par
     The data is strange.  They want to use the 35 largest cities by metro area.  (Why 35??)  They drop 6 because HUD's Continuity of Care (CoC) region covers "too large a geographic area".  The dropped cities are Houston, Riverside (CA), Denver, Orlando, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City (MO).  The rest are split into two groups, where the CoC matches the city (20 of them) or the county (10 of them).  Chicago appears in both groups.  They cover years 2007 to 2019, but admit that the PIT Count (their measure of homelessness) is iffy in some cities and especially in the early few years.

\par
     Over time, homelessness has dropped on average.  But the variance has increased.

\par
     They talk about the PIT Count ("homeless census").  Most homelessness is temporary, but some is long-term.  Because the PIT Count is a single day, it emphasizes the long-term.  If it was people over the year, the temporary ones would show up more.

\par
     Homeless are more likely to be: male, unmarried, low-income, old, non-white, and queer.  They are socially isolated: fewer family ties and far from family.  They are more likely to be depressed, mentally ill, abused drugs, abuse alcohol, have a conviction and been incarcerated.  70\% are individuals, usually male.  30\% are families, which tend to undergo temporary homelessness.

\par
    Cost per homeless is \$30,000 to \$100,000 for government services.

\par

    The book has good data on poverty, which is negatively correlated with homelessness.  Unemployment is negatively correlated with homelessness.  It is odd that they plot data points for every year and don't estimate fixed-effects for cities.  (E.g., does an increase in poverty cause an increase in homelessness?)

\par
    Mental illness and drug use are measured on a statewide-basis.  That seems to large a scale.

\par
    Race is negatively correlated with homelessness.   Black people are more likely to be homeless, but cities with more Black residents have a lower rate of homelessness!

\par
    Temperature is handled badly.  They use the average temperature for the month of January ... even though the PIT Count was on a specific day?  The county data shows no correlation of warmer winters with homelessness, but the city data does.  They fight that result by combining the data using "indexed homelessness" (described on pages 20 to 22) which is, let's say, not a well-known technique.  The annedotal evidence --- that cold NYC has more homeless than warm southern cities --- is much stronger than their data.

\par
    They admit that temperature is correlated with unsheltered homeless.  They explain that this may be because cold cities spend more on shelter than warmer cities, which may spend on outdoor services.

\par
    Generous social services is also done differently.  It measures the state's maximum TANF ("Welfare") benefit against family homelessness rate.  It uses families, because individuals rarely qualify for TANF.  This does not seem like a good measure.

\par
    The show that low-income migration is negatively correlated with homelessness.  They try to say this shows the cities with high homelessness are not "welfare magnets".  To me, that data means other things.

\par
    They handle political party annecdotally, citing that Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland are highly Democratic cities with low homelessness.  The authors inveigh against harsh police treatment of the homeless and say there is no evidence that it does more than hide the problem.

\par
    They do a strange interlude to look at cost-burden-ness as a cause of homelessness.  They find when the median person spend more on housing, homelessness goes down in cities.  But not in counties.  And the result doesn't hold when looking at the "first-quartile housing cost burden".

\par
    What should be the finale is the comparison of median rent, vacancy, first-quartile rent, and "first-quartile vacancy" (vacancy in lowest 1/4 rent apartments).  Rent and vacancy are inversely correlated and both predict homelessness.  The strongest is median rent which has an R-squared of 55\% for cities and first-quartile rent which has an R-squared of 28\% for counties.  (For vacancy, they regress against log(vacancy), which is a strange choice since both homeless rate and vacancy are on a scale of 0 to 100\%.  They don't apply log to rent, where it would be more natural.  And they don't do log(vacancy) when showing it correlates with rent.  These are inconsistent strange choices.)

\par
    Page 134 says that they did a full model with fixed-city effects ... but don't show its results.  Not even in an appendix.  WTF.  

\par
    The rest of the book doesn't follow their thesis.  They see if growth is correlated with homelessness and find it isn't.  They mention a study shows that inequality is causal ... but say it isn't in their data (without any plots).

\par
   They eventually say that economics believe supply is limited by geography (oceans, mountains, etc.) and by regulation.  They then group cities by elasticity (a measure of supply limitations) and growth.  (So, now, they're saying growth \emph{does} matter.)  And the worst cities have high growth and low elasticity.  I expected the book to end here saying "we need to fix the regulation in high-growth cities".

\par
    But, no.  We get 38 pages of their vague plan to fix homelessness.  After a data-driven book focused on proving one point, it is huge jumble of opinion at the finish.  They dismiss filtering without a citation on page 134.  They put together a mushy argument against markets on pages 171 to 173.  They say private markets won't create houses for people with no income, but ignore the idea of giving money to those people.  After citing economists ealier, they say "housing must be de-commodified".  They mention that building houses has not come down in price like building iPhones, but don't mention that most cities ban manufactured homes on most land.  It goes on: public perception, funding, and more.  Way too much for a single chapter.  

\par
    The book's data is passable --- it is clear enough to make most of their thesis's points --- but I think it needs a much stronger analysis in an appendix.  The book never really addressed how to handle correlations in data samples from the same city in different years.   The writing began well but it totally flubbed the landing.  The last chapter should have been cut and become the basis for the author's next book.  But it did well enough to make its point and that's an accomplishment.

  A very readable book that argues that zoning is unnecessary.  It describes what zoning does (restricts use, restricts size) and what it does not do (mandate construction, protect health and safety, protect the environment, plan for the future).  Zoning doesn't even "solve" the problem of externalities like noise, smell, shade, etc..  

\par
   In NYC, zoning was instituted to restrict building size.  The Equitable Building was so large that the price of office space plummeted.  Zoning limited building volume so that didn't happen again. 

\par
   Berkeley implmented an early zoning plan for other reasons.  "Residential areas" kept apartments of poor (including "negroes and Orientals") out of the suburbs.  Banning businesses kept Chinese-laundry (and the Chinese) out of the suburbs.  Berkeley's zoning was non-heirarchical --- it kept residential out of industrial areas.  This was used by business interests to force housing out of downtown areas and attract more businesses (with jobs and tax revenue).  

\par
   Zoning drives up prices.  Single-room occupancies (SROs) are banned.  Parking required.  Heights limited.  Empty land mandated.  The approval process delays housing.  Etc.  It makes cities worse and America poorer.

\par
   Zoning was enabled by and enabled segregation.  By race and class.

\par
   Fixing the problems requires loosening zoning, but the author considers abolishing it all together.  Zoning doesn't accomplish its goals.  It doesn't address most externalities and, those it does, it does roughly.  It isn't the best mechanism for planning growth.  

\par
   Houston is the example of a city without zoning.  Most of its residents' desire for zoning is fulfilled by deed restrictions, which are enforced by the city government.  Some of zoning's aspects show up elsewhere (don't build in a floodplain, optional parking minimums, some business banned everywhere in the city).  Houston is still segregated by use, but that is driven by the market.   I wish the author had gone into more detail on this important aspect of the solution: "As Siegan observes, it's not uncommon for homeowners' associations to simply pay off owners of abutting properties to avoid more offensive uses, such as gas stations or car dealerships".  (Page 155) 

\par
   The author says that if zoning is abolished, planning needs to change.  Laws need to focus on externalities directly, like noise and smell.  Planner's duties can be replaced by mediators.

\par
    The author says that planning needs to fight the segregation that it helped create.  Not just remove zoning, but use the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and Section 8 vouchers to put poorer families in high-opportunity areas.  The author believe inclusionary zoning is bad.  He supports community land trusts (CLT). (I find CLTs very very expensive for their benefit.)

\par
     The Walk Score for a zipcode was taken at its centroid.  The other variables were average rooms, average housing age, average commute time, average distance to CBD, income, vacancy, and density.  They controlled for county-level fixed effects.  (The hope this adjusts for crime and public amenities.)  They regress log(price-per-sqft) with linear effects.  It isn't clear if that is a sqft of land or interior space.   They use linear average income, not log(average income), which is strange.  In the results, they say "The coefficients on distance from the CBD, average commute... are insignficant".  That's a bad sign.

\par
     They attempt to validate the model with rental rates, which I would think would be the primary way to measure the effects.

\par
     The authors find price increases with Walk Score.  But zip codes are not randomly drawn --- they were drawn for delivery of postal mail.  Nor is the centroid of them random.  The Walk Score varies on a small scale and they should be measuring it on that scale.  I don't think they take enough confounding variables into account.  Even with the ones they do, they find a negative coefficient for both commute distance and distance to CBD.  I don't trust these results at all.

    A touching and enlightening article.  The author explains how she delt with poverty by occasionally living in her car.

\par
    It covers a lot of the practical issues of being homeless.  Low pay and expensive housing cause homelessness.  Landlords have requirements (deposit, proof of income, etc.) and discriminate against homeless (let alone incarcerated, etc.).  Roommates are problematic: propositions for sex, mental health, lack of privacy, etc..  When you live in your car, you need to find a place to park at night.  

\par
    The most important section is the first: "Homelessness is expensive".  It opened my eyes to how costs \emph{increase} as you go down the ladder.  Without a stove, you must buy pre-cooked food and cannot buy in bulk.  Without storage, you must buy a new winter coat each year.  Without a shower, you need to buy a gym membership to get clean.  With all those higher costs, trying to "climb up the ladder" is harder the lower you are.

    This is the kindest, wholehearted, literate attack I've ever read.  It is dense with ideas and feelings and examples.

\par
    The first sentence is "This book is an attack on current city planning and rebuilding."  The victims of the attack are architects and planners who think that the best cities have tall buildings in park-like environments.  (These go by brand names "City Beautiful", "Garden City" and "Radiant City".)  She also attacks governments who subsidize suburbs and who essentailly "clear the slums and rebuild". 

\par
    Her first chapter is on Safety.  She defines a city as a place with a lot of strangers and the residents of a city block (people living there and business owners) need to defend themselves from strangers.  There are 2 ways to do this.  One way is to demark "Turfs" which are patrolled by gangs (in poor areas) or private security guards (in rich ones).  The alternative is an organic defense: the dangerous person is detected, the alarm communicated to fellow residents, and enough residents mass in the street to fend off the danger.  This organic defense only comes through visibility of danger, stability of residents, communication, building of trust through voluntary interactions, and fast response. 

\par
    The organic defense is encouraged by fostering interaction of residents on sidewalks using mixed-use, short blocks, high traffic at all hours, recreation in public rather than private, etc.  You also need big windows looking over street, no blind spots, etc..  Parks are bad --- plenty of blind spots, far from windows, usually low-traffic.  It's where gangs fight, where boys sneak off to do bad things, and where the homeless gather.  A few parks, which are small and have traffic at all hours with various crowds at different times, are successes.  Activity-based amenties, like swimming pools (and libraries?), can be good.  In addition to parks, other borders between streets, like highways, railroads and rivers, also cut the organic fabric.  

\par
   Chapter 6's title says "neighborhoods" but means "governing".  The author doesn't see a boundary for a neighborhood --- the city is a continuous piece of overlapping relationships: friends, customers of business, schools, etc..  In her mind, there is your block and your city and nothing in between.  She says there is a political role to be played by districts of size about 100,000.  Basically, no citywide politician cares about your block.  You need a district size to be where someone on your block can gather enough voices from nearby blocks to get the attention of an assemblyman at the city level and that the assemblyman has enough power to get stuff done with the police, the traffic planners, etc..  She comments that many cities are not very democratic because of their structure and hoops that residents must try to run through.

\par
    Quote from pg. 181, "Here is a seeming paradox: To maintain in a neighborhood sufficient people who stay put, a city must have the very fluidity and mobility of use ..."

\par
    I have not read Chapters 7 through 15 yet.

\par
    Chapter 15 is about money.  There is real damage done to neighborhoods that could not get loans because banks blacklisted them after planners designated them as "slums" or bad.  Existing buildings are not improved; bad buildings are not torn down and replaced.  Her early example of Boston's North End is brought up.  It was only sustained and improved by people paying cash and by construction people living there.  When money does flood into a slum, it often displaces residents and destroys the social fabric.

\par
    Tax law also drove people to be slumlords.  Owners did not invest so that profits came as capital gains rather than income.  

\par
    The author mentions that eminant domain hurts because it pays only for the land/building and not everything the owner had invested betting on a stable future.  Some cities have "quick-take" laws that grab the land immediately and settle the price later, so that profiteers cannot buy property that will be later eminantly domained.

\par
    Chapter 16 is about subsidized housing.  The author has sharp comments about lack of housing is about lack of money.  She recommends subsidizing rent and guaranteed loans to building owners who provide it.  She would let owners choose their residents.  

\par
    I did not read Chapters 17 through the end.

\par
    I didn't have time to read all of this book but I want to!  It is an engaging and eye-opening.  The author has new ideas with lots of examples.  The author never uses the words "organic fabric", but that's what she means.  It's a difficult concept for planning --- improving may require a local "gardener" rather than a distance mathematical bureaucrat.  Even the first question that I'd want to ask, "how do you measure it?", is a quandry.  Page 174-179 talks about the social network in a neighborhood and mentions the number of connections between any two people.  It's a kind of "six-degrees" but within the neighborhood.  Perhaps that's a way to measure it.  But the next question, "what do planners do to make a neighborhood better connected?" gets even more complex.  Even if there's complexity, the author has redirected everyone's gaze at it.

    This is a big-thought book about the economic development of humanity, like "Guns, Germs, and Steel", by Jane Jacobs.  She wrote "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" which is a classic book that upset the world of urban planning.  This book is facinating, dense with ideas backed by anecdotes from cities.  It tries to show that cities are vital to economics and a particular process in cities drives economic growth.  My major problem with it is that it doesn't use math.  While this book is fertile for ideas, its main argument should have use the precision and rigor of mathematics to prove its point.

\par
    Her big idea is that economic growth is driven by "import substitution" in cities.  In her model of a city, it has exports, imports, export-producing industry, and (self-)consumption-producing industry.  The exports pay for the city's imports.  Growth happens rapidly when a city starts producing goods that it used to import.  E.g., Tokyo used to import bicycles, but now makes them locally.  This new industry increases the local economy but also has another effect.  The city's exports pay for the imports and now the city can buy even more of other imports.  These can help the city produce more goods that it used to import, causing growth and the cycle to happen again.  It is that cyclic feedback that Jacobs believes drives rapid growth in cities (and economies).   

\par
    The book is about more than that idea.  She believes economics is about cities.  (She points out that industry is not evenly spread across the land, but concentrated in cities.)  That cities pre-date agriculture.  (She speculates about a city in Turkey trading obsidian before argiculture.)  That the conventional story if "argiculture blooms and then cities develop" is wrong.  She says cities produce tools that help farmers be more productive.  

\par
    She has an organic view of cities.  She says cities that focus on mass production in a single industry do not grow and develop.  She thinks the best cities have an mix of small companies which grow and innovate.  The book contains many stories about new products being developed, such as 3M changing from being a mining company to making a wide varies adhesives.  She mentioned how Japan learned to make bicycles slowly: first repairing bikes, then making their own parts to repair bikes, and then, eventually, making the whole bike.  She tells the story of a factory being set up in a small town and it failing, but it succeeded quickly when relocated into a city.  She tells many stories of employees "breaking away" to start a new business.  She has a great metaphor about organic development on pg. 129: biologists once thought a fertilized egg was a tiny baby, only needing to grow larger.  We now know the egg is a single cell and the fetus develops by cells splitting and specializing.  

\par
    She has a great set of examples about how geography is not destiny.  There were other settlements near New York and London with better harbors.  Those settlements should have had the advantage in growth.  But they didn't.  Something else drove growth and development.

\par
    I will say that two of her strongest stories did not move me.  They were about the growth in Japan and Los Angeles after WWII.  Both were far away from where they imported goods from (USA, East Coast).  So, the standard economic motivations to move production locally make sense --- transportation costs were high (at that time).  It would be interesting to compare where expensive transportation drives local growth and where it does not.  In the 1600 to 1900's, colonies were far away but only some grew.  Jacob's view is that colonies were either focused on single-product mass production or the colonizers prevented locals from making imports locally.  
    
    She has distain for Adam Smith's view that specialization leads to more production.  Smith's classic example is the 10 specialists doing different jobs will make 4,800 pins per day per person, and 1 generalist struggles to make a handful.  Jacobs says "Division of labor is a device for achieving operating efficiency, nothing more." (pg. 82).  She considers the idea of creating the pin in the first place to be the important part.  Innovation eventually lead to a pin-making machine that put all the specialists out of business!  She does value the division of labor because a 10-step process has 10 (or even 45) places where innovation can occur, if allowed.  

\par
    For a book from 1969, it feels very predictive of the last 50 years.  She mentions recycling.  Investing in startups.  That services will differentiate and grow faster than manufacturing.

\par
    This is an amazing book because it has lots of stories and will get you thinking in new directions.  I don't accept its story of "import substitution", because it is too reductionist.  It may explain a city's growth but not the economy's.  Doesn't import substituion mean that manufacturing has moved from the exporting city to the importing one, not new manufacturing has been created?  It might grow the economy if local resources are used, but then it is those resources that are causing growth, not the movement of the manufacturing. 

\par
    I do like her view of cities as organic.  If we view a city as a network of processes, where each takes input goods and produces output goods, then the network can only change by little steps.  A process can grow.  A process can mutate to produce a slightly different product.  A process can move from outside the city to inside it.  A process can split or a new process can replicate an existing process.  Innovation can create a brand new process, but it still has to connect it into the network.  It helps where there are lots of places to connect it to.  That may be why cities succeed: not just lots of products for customers but lots of places in a network where innovation can find a place.

    Says that Zahavi reached an empirical conclusion from data around the world: man travels a mean of about 1 hour per day.   They believe its origination is biological, governing the territory controlled by primitive man. 

\par
    In ancient Greece, villages have a mean territory of 22 square km.  The radius is about 2.5 km and, at a walking speed of 5 km/hr, travel is about 1 hour round trip. The author claims that cities got larger due to changes in the speed of transportation technology, with similar-timed commutes.

\par
    Car travel averages about .9 hours per day, at most income levels.  Very low income people travel about .7 hours per day.  The miles driven per year in the USA is stable at 9,400.  (NOTE: This seems too stable and the value now is 13,400, so it is not stable.)   Travel consumption is stable around 13\%.  Death rates per year is also freekishly stable around 22,000 per year.  (NOTE: This doesn't match data on Wikipedia.  The number there has much more variability, but is stable around 35,000 per year.)

\par
    The paper goes on to look at communication vs. travel, with technology.  The number of messages or calls has increased exponentially, as have trips.  The number of messages/calls follows a graviational law, proportional to the populations of two cities divided by the distance apart.

\par
    City population in 1920 followed a Zipf distribution, linear in log(population) and log(rank by size).  The author claims that, if you use the 30 minute commute and include planes and high-speed trains, it still holds because of areas like the Boston-to-DC corridor.

    The author builds economic models to explain homelessness.

\par
    The basic model has 3 levels of housing: homeless, low quality, and high quality.  Agents have an income and a standard utility model, increasing in money and home quality.  The model demonstrates that poor people, in the right situtations, will choose homelessness.

\par
    The author extends this to a model with a continuum of quality ranges, from 0 to positive infinity.   And then adds construction of homes, maintenance, filtering, etc..  Models are similar to filtering models of Sweeney 1974 and Arnott 1987.

\par
    On page 49, the author looks at "compartive dynamics".  That is, how changes in income distribution, interest rates, and other factors affect the housing market.  I didn't read all the details.

\par
    Other aspects of housing are considered: rent collection costs, public housing, shelters, building codes, and tastes.

    I think the model is more complicated than necessary to explain the homelessness dynamics.  There isn't any data connecting it to the real world.  Still, the author seems pretty happy with it.

    The book starts pretty boring.  Chapter 2 is a discussion of the various definitions of "homeless".  For example, are people in a shelter "homeless"?   Chapter 3 is an undramatic discussion of why homelessness is bad for other people.  Strangely, for an economist, it doesn't try to put it in financial terms.  Chapter 4 is a history of homelessness and data for it.  Which is pretty awful, up to 1996.

\par
    Chapter 5 is interesting: it compares the homeless, who sleep outdoors or in shelters, to what most people call "homeless", the people that beg, collect cans, and wash windshields.  He refers to those as "colloquially homeless" or "daytime streetpeople" or simply "streetpeople".  There is overlap.  The author's study in New York said about 3/4 of streetpeople are homeless, but 1/4 live with someone or have their own place.  Most have slept in a shelter but do not like them.   The streetpeople earn a variable income that is below minimum wage.  Those that reported hours worked around 7 hours a day.  2/3 work 7 days a week; the rest are evenly split between 1 and 6 days a week.   3/4 say they would take a low-wage job.  About 1/2 get public assistance, which might go away with a job.  If given extra money, about 1/3 said they would spend it on alcohol or drugs.  2/3 said they didn't have a way to save money!  

\par
    Chapter 6 describes an economic model of housing and homelessness, without any equations.  But it uses phrases like "price-quality schedule", so good luck understanding the chapter without an advanced econ degree.  I have one and, for me, it might have been easier with some equations.  The model has a high-end market, where houses are built and maintained, a low-end market, where houses are not maintained and deteriorate in quality, and, finally, homelessness.  The interesting part is the low-end market, where changes in costs ripple down determine who is homeless.  It is a model of a market at equilbrium and the author walks through various scenarios that will change the equilibrium.  They're summarized in Table 6-1 at the end of the chapter.  It is a well-constructed model but I'm not sure how well it represents reality.  Buildings take decades to age, so are cities actually near equilibrium?  Also, the

\par
    Chapter 7 looks at the effect of income inequality.  The author uses an unusual metric: the slope of a line fitted to the lower-half of an income histogram.  Yeah.  Very unusual.  He leaves out a lot of details.  He claims that it explains homelessness very well, "allowing for lags" (pg. 132).  But what is an appropriate amount of "lag"?   Increases in the price of low-rent housing predicts homelessness.  On page 142 he starts a history of very low-rent housing.  Every place has a different name and regulation for them: flop houses, SROs, cubicle hotels, etc.  Many closed due to profitability in the early 80's.  Some had high vacancies.  It's not clear why that explains anything.  He uses fire reports and demolition records but I don't find the data and/or story compelling.

\par
    Chapter 8 looks at financial influences on housing.  Interest rates and inflation are too small to affect operating costs in his model.  The opportunity cost of land (which he calls "gentrification").  This didn't explain homelessness in the 80's, but it might now in Austin and San Francisco.

\par
    Chapter 9 examines other studies that compare multiple cities against each other.  It includes Tucker 1987, Tucker 1987b, Quigley 1990, Elliot and Krivo 1991, Burt 1992, and Honig and Filer 1993.  He doesn't like their data.  ! There are different definition of metro-area: Census Bureau and Rand-McNally.  Pg. 167 has some insights: "wealthier cieites should provide more shelter, since charity is a normal good, and so should cities with more valuable real estate, since removing homeless people from such real estate yields a higher return".  

\par
    Chapter 10 covers government.  "New York has not prevented the construction of shanties, but has confined their construction to the most primitive technology."  And, now, Austin has confined people to tents.  He mentioned that health regulations may include window size, ventilation, and minimum floor area to limit the spread of TB.  He says that regulations may be needed to keep buildings maintained: the owner going bankrupt will not profit from maintenance (the bank will) and may not maintain the building.  He notes a distinction between "grandfathered" regulation, where the existing uncompliant are legalized, and "retrofit" regulations, which requires owners to invest to meet the standard.  Owners of grandfathered buildings have "something valuable --- an exemption from regulation".  NYC banned SROs, but the author doesn't think it affected homelessness.  One argument is high vacancy rates.  One cost is parking spaces, even if the law only requires 1 for every 6 rooms.  Low-cost landlords suffer from caparicious enforcement of rules.  Rent control means owners do not invest in maintenance and that owners discriminate on residents (rather than price), which may mean the unhoused are "lemons" that the landlords don't want.  Making evictions harder hurts low-cost landlords, because more tenants are disruptive and fewer can pay (or have seizable assets) to make up for the eviction costs.  "A former SRO owner in Newark, for instances, gave as his main reason for leaving the business the hassle and liability that had become part of it; he thought that the only perons who would buy a cheap hotel now was the 'thickest-skinned SOB in the world'.".  O'Flaherty thinks tenants rights contributed high vacancy and, a small amount, to homelessness.  He believes "public housing for the middle class increases homelessness; ... for the very poor, reduces it.".  1/3 of homeless women in a shelter said they would't live in Chicago public housing due to the lack of safety.

\par
He says Section 8 has a certificate, which pays the difference between actual rent and 30\% of income, and a voucher, which pays the difference between "fair market rent" and 30\% of income.  Those with voucher still need their residence checked by the housing authority!  Why?!   Food stamp funds increase with rent, so it's a rental assistance program!  WTF?!

\par
Rental vacancy was studied by Rosen and Smith 1983 and Arnott 1989. Vacancy is complicated.  Pairing a landlord with a tenant is a two-sided process.  Landlords decide the rent and also how much to advertise and any renter requirements.  Tenants decide their price limits, where to search, how much to search, and how much effort to meet landlords' requirements.  Vacancy around 7\% or 9\% is "natural".  O'Flaherty doesn't think vacancy explain homelessness.

\par
   Chapter 11 is about welfare ("income maintenance") in wealthy countries.  New York's General Assistance encouraged living on the street:  Unsheltered receive \$305; those in a shelter get \$149.   Bureaucracy in the USA makes it hard to sign up \emph{and} hard to stay on the list.  "one chance in eight of opening a case and maintaining it for a year."  System is complex and time-consuming.  Making and keeping appointments is difficult for homeless.   Many homeless seek independence and avoid hassle.  Mental health and disability determinations are hard and bureaucratic.  (They're medical decisions in Canada.)  Programs incentivize black-market work, like begging and cleaning windshields, because official job income reduces their income from SSI or other programs.  The "tax" is 100\% for New York's general assistance.
   
\par
   Under sharing housing, the author says social security (SSI) and foot stamps have "strong disincentives for sharing housing".  SSI reduces by 1/3.  Foodstamps give more for 2 people living apart than living together.  This programs were growing rapidly in the 1970s, before homelessness took off in the 1980s!

\par
   Chapter 12 is about mental health.  The chapter looks at the release of people from mental hospitals in the 1960s and says that was unlikely to be a cause of homelessness later.  Some women make themselves dirty and act crazy to scare off attackers.  For low-cost housing where people shared rooms, a few people with mental health problems has a large effect.  Also, repair costs and liability go up.  Many have "innkeeper liability", which means the law blames them for bad guests causing problems to other guests!  There may be a tipping point, where enough mentally ill poison all low-cost housing, but the author finds little evidence for it.

\par
   Chapter 13 is about drugs.  Taking drugs is a choice and the author sweetly says, "Volition means economics."  He says crack became popular because it is cheap.  (Powdered cocaine was sold by gram; crack by 1/20th of a gram.)  Different drugs are substitutes and crack displaced powdered cocaine and amphetamines.  Maybe alcohol too.  But crack is not a substitute for housing!  Cheaper highs mean that more money is left for housing.  Housing demand should have increased!

\par
   But that analysis skips a lot, such as the lost productive hours of someone who gets high and the instability of highs and lows (which causes people to lose jobs).  And maybe other changes?   Drugs and alcohol are common amoung shelter residents.  Half took cocaine in one study.  Cocaine use did spike in the 1980s.  Cirrhosis deaths spiked in the 1970s ... why?   The timing of homelessness doesn't really line up with emergency room visits.  The author concludes that "at least as good an argument can be made that crack reduced homelessness as that it increased homelessness.". 

\par
   Chapter 14 is about cops and prisons.  Many homeless have been in jail (31\%) or prison (18\%).  Homelessness doesn't cause people to go to prison, but releases of prisoners increases homelessness.  They have a hard time getting work, may have a harder time finding a place to rent, and have fewer social connections to help.  Prisoner releases didn't cause the problems in the 1980's, but maybe contribute today?  Common laws used against homeless are: loitering (unconstitutional), vagrancy (unconstitutional), obstructing sidewalks, begging, public drinking or drunkenness, and commitment to mental institutions.  Police are usually sympathetic to the homeless: they have to deal with them regularly, there's little benefit in conflict, and the police like support from other institutions who might react negatively if they abuse the homeless.  Police just displace the homeless, not fix things.  Homeless might prefer jail, with warmth and food.  We don't have much data on Black homelessness during the 1950's and 1960's, but it increased in 1970's.  Why?   The author mentions less racism, but doesn't mention migration, which happened then.

\par
   Chapter 15 is the author's diagnosis and prescription.  He thinks homelessness in NYC in the 1980's was caused by the "middle class shrinking" (income distribution changes) in the 1970's.  His model predicts that less low-cost housing was provided.  Also contributing were zoning regulations, strict housing-maintenance laws, difficulty evicting tenants, more ex-prisoners, and more generous shelters.  Low priced crack may have helped end homelessness.  Newark's story is similar.  Chicago didn't see a shift in the income distribution and didn't see homelessness.  He waves his hands with Toronto.  He dodges with London and Hamburg.  In fact, he goes so far as to say "perhaps maintenance is cheap relative to construction so that the models of Chapter 6 don't apply."!!!  This is my biggest problem with his model: how does he know it works at all?

\par
    His policy recommendations are: Do not discriminate against or in favor of the homeless.  E.g., different welfare payments, access to services, etc..   The police should focus on crime, not anti-social behavior.  This includes prosecuting crimes against the homeless and crimes by the homeless.  He says police should do "aggressive but nonpunitive referral" but I'm not sure what that means.  Right after, he talks about the Port Authority bus terminal and Grand Central terminal being clear of homeless.  He says that the homeless should \emph{not} be allowed to build shanties, because they're unsafe and violate the law.

\par
    Cities should not run shelters; they should hand out an allowance and let private companies run shelters.  Shelters will then compete to be the preferred place and improve services to the homeless. (Cities may run shelters for natural disasters, etc.)  Private shelters should be allowed to offer better rooms for cash on top of the allowance, creating a working market for low-cost housing.  (NOTE: In Austin, there is probably a huge discontinuity between a free bed in a shelter and \$700 for an apartment!)  The author prefers entitlements, because they provide predictability for everyone.  For disruptive homeless people, which private shelters will not house for the allowance, he recommends selectively increasing the allowance.  "This scheme won't work perfectly ... but I can think of no scheme that would work better."  (NOTE: Let charities deal with them?)  Later, on page 289, he says "A commitment to zero homelessness is unworkable".

\par
    He describes public housing rules as giving "authorities a choice between running empty buildings and running buildings full of fairly well-off people".  A study says that for every \$2 spent on public housing, residents would pay only \$1 for it.  His non-discrimination policy says that homeless should \emph{not} move to the front of the queue for public housing.  He also says that there shouldn't be a waiting list for public housing --- it should be a random draw of all applicants!  (Waiting longer doesn't mean "more deserving".)

\par
    As for regulations, he doesn't like "apex zoning" ("hierarchical zoning", I believe).  It should be easy to evict for any reason (not just "good cause").  He points out that eviction takes time and money and, for poor residents, putting a lein on their possessions won't pay for it.  (NOTE: Does this mean that it would be a good policy to pay landlords for evictions, as a form of insurance?)  He says we should remove "innkeeper liability" for lodginghouses and SROs; they should have the same liability as apartments.  (NOTE: I'm not sure I agree with this; I think allowing eviction for any reason would help fix this.)

\par
    He says working homeless are good, because busy people cause fewer problems than welfare clients.  He suggests finding productive work, paid in cash, in small amounts quickly.  He suggest paying for each small piece of work.  He suggests getting rid of the disincentives in assistance plans.  He suggests hiring should be informal and without any eligibility criteria.  His example of a good program is "Street News" newspaper in Chicago and recycling cans in NYC.  He suggests discouraging begging by allowing charities, like Salvation Army, to solicit on the streets!

\par
    He suggests getting rid of the disincentives for doubling up in SSI and foodstamps.  He suggests reducing effective marginal tax rates.  For drug abusers, he says we should make it easier for them to get money like SSI.  He suggests disability should be more than yes-no proposition, but have degrees.  Lastly, US programs need to be as friendly and accessible as Canadian ones.

The median shelter homeless spell is well under a month, and even “chronic homelessness” officially entails spells of a year or so. I model homelessness as part of people’s lives in a dynamic stochastic framework in continuous time. I can explain many empirical regularities with a parsimonious model: for instance, why the last addresses of homeless people are concentrated in a few low-rent neighborhoods, why homeless entries are hard to predict, why recidivism is common and past homelessness is a good predictor of future homelessness, why some groups recidivate more often than others, why the hazard rate for shelter exit is single-peaked, why effective homelessness prevention programs do not alter the average length of homeless spells. I also examine policy. The optimal homelessness prevention program is Pigouvian and starkly simple. With an optimal prevention program in place, optimal shelter quality maximizes a simple and intuitive expression, and insurance programs always raise social welfare. Most of the previous economics literature about homelessness has been static, but most literature about homelessness outside economics has been dynamic. This paper tries to bring the two strands of literature closer together.},

    The author builds a simple stocastic-calculus model of an individual's wealth and, when their wealth falls to zero, the individual goes homeless.   By "simple", I mean it is still stocastic calculus and heavy on the math.

\par
    The author's model leads to an obvious policy: a "Pigouvian homelessness prevention program".  That is, assuming homelessness has negative externalities (like smoking causes second-hand lung cancer), the government pays a subsidy if you are housed (like subsidizing people not to smoke).  Usually the Pigouvian response is a tax, like a heavy cigarette tax, but taxing the homeless would be cruel.   He says "he optimal shelter quality (and street enforcement regime) maximizes the instantaneous difference between benefits and costs".  

\par
    Another policy is income smoothing.  He concludes that "any actuarily fair insurance that reduces volatility is welfare-improving.".

    It has an interesting discussion of the strengths of studies that focus on individual vs. averages.  Practioners want individual studies, since it informs how they act.  But they don't provide information on solving homelessness.

\par
    It has some interesting insights on the "general equilibrium", by which the author means how everyone in the housing market reacts to a policy.  A shelter is more pleasant than sleeping rough, so more shelters means that fewer will sleep rough and, also, that some people will stay longer.  So, Housing First treats the homeless, but there aren't studies on what it does to the system.

\par
    One simple model has a rate $e$ at which the homed become homeless and a rate $x$ at whick the homeless become homed.  The steadystate homeless rate is $e/x$.  

\par
    Discusses treatments, where money seems to be best.  Mentions that rent is factor.   Some non-housing interventions help, but they're relatively expensive.

\par
    Journeys Home is a longitudinal study that covers Australians beyond homelessness.  It produced a lot of good data.  For men, trauma was seen on entering and exiting homelessness.  Women experienced trauma while homeless.  Violence might cause male homelessness, but not female.   Addiction, in general, was not a cause of homelessness.  Although heavy alcohol use (a binge) might be causal. 

\par
    An increase in EITC payments lead to fewer families doubling up.  But it didn't decrease homelessness.  The author asks "Why might this be?" and guesses either it has to do with averages or the near-homeless didn't apply for EITC.

\par
    Evictions often preceed homelessness.  Giving legal representation during evictions help prevent them.  But no one has studied if landlords change in response.

\par
    He casts a lot of doubt on HUD's Annual Homeless Assessment Report.  This includes the Point-in-Time Count ("homeless census", "PIT Count").

\par
    His own paper (2003) looked at shelter quality and the quality of living outside (rain, worse spots to camp) and computed an equilibrium for how many homeless would choose each.  It says how the number of beds affects numbers too --- meaning 100 more beds reduces the PIT Count by much fewer than 100!  Permanent supportive housing is very high quality housing and has a predictable effect.  

\par
    When prisoners are released, shelter numbers do not increase.  But that may be because recently released criminals scare people away?

\par
    If housing is given to those homeless longest, it might incentivize people to stay homeless longer to increase their odds of "winning a lottery".  

\par
   Corinth 2017 has formula for predicting homelessness.

\par
   NYC ran a service "Homebase" which prioritized treated people in their neighborhoods.  I'm not sure all the details, but it kept social connections.

\par
   Prevention is tricky.  Rolston et al. found 14.5\% of their control group entered shelters and 8.0\% of the treatment group.  Since only 6.5\% were affected, the program could be expensive for the effect.

\par
   People have private information on how likely they are to be homeless.  Still, practioners may find it hard to get honest answers when the treatment depends on the answer.  The Homebase program saw evidence with long walks to services.  The NYC housing program does it by requiring long stays at a shelter before getting housing support.

\par
   In NYC, homelessness increased from 2011 to 2017, but the housing market was mostly unchanged.  Vacancy in low-rent apartments fell by 1/3, but it was not significant.  Migration doesn't explain shifts in numbers, even in the NY/NJ area.   LA saw a similar rise in the city but not surrounding areas.

\par
   Under Mayor De Blasio, NYC raised \$-per-family-day from \$103 to \$171.  (NYC sometimes rents hotel rooms and that's close to the price of one.)

\par
   On page 62, does a "thought experiment" of how many Housing Choice Vouchers would be necessary to replace NYC's shelters and other programs.  He believes the money currently spent (\$1.8 billion) might be able to do it.
   
   Pg. 66 says LA's survey is different from NYC in major ways.  E.g., visual not interviews.  No transit.  Non-random.  Crappy in every way.   

\par
   LA spends far less on homeless services: 1/15th that of NYC!   That rose to about 1/3 in 2017.   "prevention in Los Angeles might also require \$30,000 to reduce the PIT Count by 1".  Wow.  He compares that to rent subsidies, which in NYC, cost \$40,000 to \$80,000 to reduce the PIT Count by 1. 

\par
   Economists have not studied the unsheltered homeless.  Is the difference between cities a matter of enforcement?

\par
   Veterans saw a big decrease in homelessness from 2010 to 2016.  But the age range for high homelessness (18 to 64) also fell sharply.  There was a large voucher program (HUD-VASH) but it may have had little effect.

\par
   Homeless families fell by 2/3s between 2010 and 2017.  It could be because NY state takes kids from homeless families and other states copied that.  There are other possibilities.

\par
   Black people are more likely to be homeless, but states with more Black residents tend to have fewer homeless.  Drug rates, alcohol abuse, and mental illness are the same rate in Blacks as in other groups.  The proportion of Black incarcerated is similar to those homeless.  The author says another candidate explanation is segregation: a shelter full of Black people may be offputting to White people.  (But wouldn't that push up the number of unsheltered White homeless?)

\par
    The conclusion says: "We don't know how to end homelessness."  "We can't explain why homelessness in the two biggest American cities exploded in this decade, or why it fell in the rest of the country."  "On an aggregate level, weather, labor market conditions, and housing prices affect homelessness, and maybe policies too, but modest changes in unemployment or rents cannot be expected to trigger huge changes in homelessness."  "...; for the most effective policies a handful ro two of people have to be treated to reduce aggregate homelessness by one."   "It's a good time for more economists to start working on homelessness."

We utilize essentially all the systematic information available on homelessness in US urban areas - census counts, shelter bed counts, records of transfer payments, and administrative agency estimates. We use these data to estimate the effects of housing prices, vacancies, and rentto-income ratios upon the incidence of homelessness. Our results suggest that simple economic principles governing the availability and pricing of housing and the growth in demand for the lowest quality housing explain a large portion of the variation in homelessness among US metropolitan housing markets. Furthermore, rather modest improvements in the affordability of rental housing or its availability can substantially reduce the incidence of homelessness in the US.},

     I quickly skimmed this paper.

\par
     It tries to find the contributing factors to homelessness.

\par
     It first looks at the theory that the mentally ill were no longer in institutions.  It finds the prison population increased proportionally.  The remaining 34,000 were too few to account for the 100,000+ increase in homeless over the period.

\par
     They interpret O’Flaherty (1996) as saying income inequality can lead to a class of older housing where rent is too low to pay for the maintenance.  Thus, residents must choose between substandard housing or homelessness.  (Note to self: the oldest housing in Austin is near downtown.  Growth has caused the least-valuable buildings to be on very valuable land.  Has this wrecked filtering?)

     Did not finish.

     Brendan O'Flaherty mentioned this as one paper connecting homelessness to inequality.

These predictions could be used to allocate different interventions across populations based on individual characteristics. In many domains, like social services, the availability of different possible interventions can be severely resource limited. This paper considers possible improvements to the allocation of such services in the context of homelessness service provision in a major metropolitan area. Using data from the homeless system, we use a counterfactual approach to show potential for substantial benefits in terms of reducing the number of families who experience repeat episodes of homelessness by choosing optimal allocations (based on predicted outcomes) to a fixed number of beds in different types of homelessness service facilities. Such changes in the allocation mechanism would not be without tradeoffs, however; a significant fraction of households are predicted to have a higher probability of re-entry in the optimal allocation than in the original one. We discuss the efficiency, equity and fairness issues that arise and consider potential implications for policy.&lt;/p&gt;},

    This paper uses AI to decide which homeless people to assign to which treatment, such as sending them to the homeless shelter or rapid rehousing.

\par
    I skimmed the paper.

\par
    It looks to use the finite resources to minimize the rentry of people into homelessness.  It identifies the most important factors, to the AI, to diagnose and prevent reentry.  There are ethical considerations and the authors looked at a system that, for any individual, only increased their chance of becoming homeless again by a fixed amount.

    The Director of Austin's Planning and Development Review responded to City Council request to look at "micro units", which have less than 500 square feet of space.  It defines them and the restrictions in Austin's zoning and building code.

\par
    He says micro units are already legal to build, as small as 250 sqft., but other parts of the code interfere with building them.   "Site area requirements specify the minimum amount of land required per dwelling unit. In Austin’s zoning code, these requirements differ depending on the zoning district.  ... Under Austin’s current code, the smallest site area requirement is 800 square feet, for efficiency units located in MF-5 zoning."

\par
    Also, there is a parking requirement.  He says "Austin’s multifamily use requires at least one space per dwelling, unless it meets one of the above conditions for reduced parking.  That means that aside from CBD and DMU zoning districts, a multifamily development will have close to one parking spot per dwelling
(at the 20\% central core reduction) or more."

    Focuses on William A. Niskanen's theory that bureaucrats maximize their agency's discretionary budget.  Presumes it can be measured by looking at City Managers who contract outside.  When going outside, the price is visible to their "polical sponsor".  So, if City Managers contract outside more than other top city officials, it validates the theory.  

\par
    Concludes: "City manager cities are slightly more likely to contract out. This general pattern of contracting out is more in line with the professionalism in government hypothesis than the greedy bureaucrat hypothesis."
